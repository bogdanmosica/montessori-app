# Phase 0: Research - Admin Payments Management

## Technology Decisions

### Payment Processing Architecture
**Decision**: Use Stripe SDK with server-side integration and webhook handling  
**Rationale**: 
- Stripe provides comprehensive payment processing for both card and bank transfers
- Webhook support ensures reliable payment status updates
- Server-side processing maintains PCI compliance
- Existing Stripe integration in montessori-app provides foundation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct bank transfer API (rejected: complex compliance requirements)
- PayPal integration (rejected: less comprehensive for recurring payments)
- Multiple payment processors (rejected: increased complexity)

### Data Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Store payment records permanently in PostgreSQL with Stripe metadata sync  
**Rationale**:
- Meets requirement for permanent invoice storage from clarifications
- Enables fast queries for payment history without API calls
- Multi-tenant data isolation aligns with constitutional requirements
- Provides audit trail for regulatory compliance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Always fetch from Stripe API (rejected: performance and availability concerns)
- Cache-only approach (rejected: data permanence requirement)
- Hybrid real-time fallback (rejected: complexity for MVP)

### Multi-Tenant Payment Scoping
**Decision**: Scope all payment queries by school/tenant ID with parent-child relationships  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for multi-tenant security
- Payments linked to active children enrollment ensures proper billing scope
- Prevents cross-tenant data leakage in payment processing
- Supports school-specific payment configurations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Global payment processing (rejected: security violations)
- Parent-scoped only (rejected: admin needs school-wide visibility)
- Simple user-based scoping (rejected: insufficient for institutional billing)

### Authentication & Authorization
**Decision**: Extend existing Auth.js RBAC with Admin-only payment access  
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing authentication infrastructure
- Admin role restriction aligns with specifications
- Session invalidation on role changes maintains security
- Access logging provides audit compliance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate payment authentication (rejected: complexity)
- Role-based UI hiding (rejected: insufficient security)
- Permission-based granular access (rejected: overkill for MVP)

## Integration Patterns

### Stripe Webhook Processing
**Pattern**: Server-side webhook handlers with idempotent processing  
**Implementation**: Next.js API routes with signature verification  
**Data Flow**: Webhook → validate → update local records → trigger UI updates

### Parent-Child Payment Association
**Pattern**: Payment records linked to child enrollment with school scoping  
**Query Strategy**: Always include school_id and active enrollment filters  
**Business Logic**: Payment amounts calculated from active children tuition

### Real-time Payment Status
**Pattern**: Server-sent events or polling for payment status updates  
**Fallback Strategy**: Local database records provide immediate display  
**Update Mechanism**: Stripe webhooks update local state asynchronously

## Performance Considerations

### Database Query Optimization
- Index on school_id, parent_id, payment_date for fast filtering
- Composite indexes for common admin dashboard queries
- Pagination for large payment history datasets
- Connection pooling for concurrent admin users

### Stripe API Rate Limiting
- Batch operations where possible to reduce API calls
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit handling
- Cache frequently accessed data locally
- Use Stripe webhooks to reduce polling needs

### UI Performance
- Server-side rendering for initial payment data
- Client-side updates only for interactive elements
- Lazy loading for large payment history lists
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback capability

## Security & Compliance

### PCI Compliance Strategy
- Never store raw payment card data
- Use Stripe Elements for secure card input
- Server-side payment processing only
- Audit logging for all payment operations

### Multi-Tenant Data Protection
- Row-level security in database queries
- API endpoint tenant validation
- Encrypted sensitive data at rest
- Secure session management

### Audit & Logging Requirements
- All admin payment actions logged to access_logs
- Payment state changes tracked with timestamps
- Failed payment attempts recorded for investigation
- Compliance-ready export capabilities

## Error Handling Strategy

### Stripe API Failures
- Graceful degradation to cached data
- Clear error messages for admin users
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Manual reconciliation tools for discrepancies

### Payment Processing Errors
- Detailed error categorization (card declined, insufficient funds, etc.)
- Admin notification system for failed payments
- Parent notification integration for payment issues
- Recovery workflows for common failure scenarios

## Testing Strategy

### Contract Testing
- Mock Stripe API responses for consistent testing
- Webhook payload validation tests
- Multi-tenant data isolation verification
- Payment flow integration tests

### Security Testing
- RBAC enforcement validation
- SQL injection protection verification
- Cross-tenant data access prevention
- Session security and timeout testing

### Performance Testing
- Database query performance under load
- Stripe API integration stress testing
- UI responsiveness with large datasets
- Multi-tenant concurrent access simulation
