## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a School Administrator, I need to monitor and manage parent payments and billing information so that I can track tuition payments, handle payment issues, process refunds, and ensure the school's financial operations run smoothly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as an Admin, **When** I navigate to /admin/payments, **Then** I can see my school's current subscription plan, status, and renewal date
2. **Given** I am on the payments page, **When** I view the payment history section, **Then** I can see a chronological list of past invoices and charges with amounts and dates
3. **Given** there is a failed payment, **When** I access the payments page, **Then** I see a prominent alert about the failed charge with clear next steps
4. **Given** I need to update payment information, **When** I click the update payment method button, **Then** I am directed to a secure payment update flow
   - Acceptance: Payment update flow uses PCI-compliant Stripe elements; sensitive data is never stored locally; error handling and confirmation are provided.
5. **Given** I want to change subscription plans, **When** I select upgrade/downgrade options, **Then** I am presented with available plans and pricing changes
6. **Given** I need a receipt, **When** I click download on any invoice, **Then** I receive a PDF copy of that invoice

### Edge Cases
System maintains full admin access to payments page even when subscription is canceled, allowing reactivation
   - Acceptance: Admin can access all payment features after cancellation; reactivation option is visible; no data loss occurs.
Expired payment methods are flagged and cannot be used for new payments
   - Acceptance: Expired methods are visually distinguished; user is prompted to update or select a valid method; error shown if attempted.
Subscription transitions (upgrade/downgrade in progress) display current and pending plan details
   - Acceptance: UI shows both current and pending plan, with effective dates and pricing; no interruption to payment features.
Partial refunds or prorated charges are itemized in payment history and invoices
   - Acceptance: Refunds/prorated charges are shown as separate line items with clear amounts and reasons; totals are updated accordingly.

### Key Entities
- **Subscription**: Represents the school's current billing plan including plan type, status (active/past_due/canceled), renewal date, and pricing tier
- **Payment History**: Collection of parent payment transactions including tuition payments, fees, refunds, and payment status with timestamps and amounts
- **Payment Method**: Parent payment information for both bank transfers and Stripe payments with secure handling
- **Payment Alert**: Notifications about payment issues such as failed parent payments, overdue accounts, or processing errors that require admin attention
