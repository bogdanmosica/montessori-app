# Feature Specification: Student Profiles & Observations

**Feature Branch**: `015-develop-student-profiles`  
**Created**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop Student Profiles & Observations in the Teacher Module of montessori-app. Expand the /teacher/students section so each student profile shows real enrollment data and allows Teachers to record observations."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description parsed: Teacher module enhancement for student profiles with observation features
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Teachers
   ‚Üí Actions: View student profiles, record observations, edit observations
   ‚Üí Data: Student enrollment data, observations/notes with timestamps
   ‚Üí Constraints: Teacher role access only, chronological tracking
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked specific clarifications needed for deletion behavior and multi-teacher access
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow identified from requirements to viewing profiles and managing observations
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and specific to the feature scope
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Students, Observations, Teachers clearly defined with relationships
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items remain for edge cases
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: How should the system handle observation deletion? ‚Üí A: No deletion - observations can only be created and edited, never removed
- Q: Should observation edits maintain an audit history of changes? ‚Üí A: Show last modified info - track when edited but not content history
- Q: Can multiple Teachers add observations for the same student? ‚Üí A: Yes - any Teacher can add observations for any student they have access to
- Q: What should be displayed when a student has no observations yet? ‚Üí A: Empty state message encouraging Teachers to add first observation

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Teacher in the montessori-app system, I need to access detailed profiles for my assigned students and maintain a record of observations about their activities and progress. I want to view each student's enrollment information, add timestamped notes about their learning journey, and be able to review the complete history of observations in chronological order.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in Teacher, **When** I navigate to /teacher/students, **Then** I see a list of all students assigned to me
2. **Given** I am viewing my student list, **When** I click on a specific student, **Then** I am taken to their detailed profile page
3. **Given** I am on a student's profile page, **When** I view their information, **Then** I see their basic details and enrollment information from the database
4. **Given** I am on a student's profile page, **When** I want to add an observation, **Then** I can use a form to create a new timestamped note
5. **Given** I have existing observations for a student, **When** I view their profile, **Then** I see all observations listed chronologically with most recent first
6. **Given** I have created an observation, **When** I need to make changes, **Then** I can edit the observation (deletion not permitted to maintain historical record)
7. **Given** I am not a Teacher, **When** I try to access /teacher/students, **Then** I am denied access

### Edge Cases
- System handles empty observation states with encouraging messaging to promote Teacher engagement

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST restrict access to /teacher/students and student profile pages to users with Teacher role only
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of students assigned to the authenticated Teacher
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide detailed student profile pages accessible by clicking on students from the list
- **FR-004**: System MUST display student basic information and enrollment details from existing database records
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow Teachers to create new observations with timestamped notes for any of their assigned students
- **FR-006**: System MUST display all observations for a student in chronological order with most recent entries first
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow Teachers to edit any existing observations for students they have access to
- **FR-008**: System MUST NOT allow deletion of observations - observations can only be created and edited to maintain complete historical record
- **FR-009**: System MUST associate each observation with the Teacher who created it, timestamp creation time, and track last modification time without preserving edit history
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist all observation data to ensure continuity across sessions
- **FR-011**: System MUST display an encouraging empty state message when a student has no observations, prompting Teachers to add their first observation
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow any Teacher with access to a student to create observations for that student

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Student**: Represents enrolled children with basic information (name, age) and enrollment details, linked from existing children and enrollments database tables
- **Observation**: Represents teacher notes about student activities and progress, containing text content, timestamps for creation and updates, and references to both the student and creating teacher
- **Teacher**: Represents authenticated users with teacher role who can view assigned students and create observations
