# Quickstart: Student Profiles & Observations

## Feature Validation Workflow

This quickstart guide provides step-by-step validation scenarios to verify the Student Profiles & Observations feature works correctly.

### Prerequisites
- Montessori-app development environment running
- Database with sample data (children, enrollments, users with Teacher role)
- Authentication system functional
- Test Teacher account available

### Test Scenario 1: Teacher Dashboard Access
**Validates**: FR-001, FR-002 (Access control and student list display)

1. **Setup**: 
   - Log in as Teacher user
   - Ensure Teacher has assigned students in database

2. **Actions**:
   - Navigate to `/teacher/students`
   - Verify page loads without errors

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Page accessible to Teacher role only
   - ✅ Student list displays assigned students
   - ✅ Each student shows: name, age, enrollment status
   - ✅ No students from other schools visible

4. **Validation Queries**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify multi-tenant scoping
   SELECT c.firstName, c.lastName, e.status 
   FROM children c 
   JOIN enrollments e ON c.id = e.childId 
   WHERE e.schoolId = [TEACHER_SCHOOL_ID];
   ```

### Test Scenario 2: Student Profile Navigation
**Validates**: FR-003, FR-004 (Profile access and data display)

1. **Setup**: 
   - Start from teacher student list page
   - Identify specific student for testing

2. **Actions**:
   - Click on student name/card
   - Navigate to student profile page

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Profile page loads at `/teacher/students/[studentId]`
   - ✅ Student basic info displayed (name, age, enrollment details)
   - ✅ Enrollment information shown (status, date, program)
   - ✅ Observations section present (may be empty initially)

### Test Scenario 3: Create First Observation
**Validates**: FR-005, FR-011, FR-012 (Observation creation and empty state)

1. **Setup**: 
   - Start from student profile page
   - Student with no existing observations preferred

2. **Actions**:
   - Locate "Add Observation" button/form
   - Enter test observation: "Student showed excellent focus during math activity"
   - Submit observation

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Empty state message visible before creation
   - ✅ Observation form accepts input
   - ✅ New observation appears in chronological list
   - ✅ Observation shows teacher name and timestamp
   - ✅ Database record created with proper relationships

4. **Validation Queries**:
   ```sql
   -- Verify observation creation
   SELECT o.note, o.createdAt, u.email as teacher, c.firstName 
   FROM observations o
   JOIN users u ON o.teacherId = u.id
   JOIN children c ON o.studentId = c.id
   WHERE o.studentId = [TEST_STUDENT_ID];
   ```

### Test Scenario 4: Edit Existing Observation
**Validates**: FR-007, FR-009 (Observation editing and timestamp tracking)

1. **Setup**: 
   - Student profile with at least one observation
   - Note original observation content and timestamp

2. **Actions**:
   - Click edit button on existing observation
   - Modify observation text
   - Save changes

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Edit form pre-populated with current content
   - ✅ Updated observation displays modified text
   - ✅ `updatedAt` timestamp newer than `createdAt`
   - ✅ No edit history preserved (as specified)
   - ✅ Original creation timestamp preserved

### Test Scenario 5: Multi-Teacher Collaboration
**Validates**: FR-012 (Multiple teachers can add observations)

1. **Setup**: 
   - Two Teacher accounts from same school
   - Both have access to same student

2. **Actions**:
   - Teacher A adds observation to student
   - Log out, log in as Teacher B
   - Navigate to same student profile
   - Teacher B adds different observation

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Teacher B can see Teacher A's observation
   - ✅ Teacher B can add new observation
   - ✅ Teacher B can edit Teacher A's observation (per clarifications)
   - ✅ Both observations show correct teacher attribution
   - ✅ Chronological ordering maintained

### Test Scenario 6: No Deletion Verification
**Validates**: FR-008 (No deletion capability)

1. **Setup**: 
   - Student profile with existing observations

2. **Actions**:
   - Examine observation list interface
   - Look for delete buttons/options

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ No delete buttons present
   - ✅ No delete confirmation dialogs
   - ✅ All observations remain permanently accessible
   - ✅ Edit functionality available instead

### Test Scenario 7: Access Control Validation
**Validates**: FR-001 (Role-based access control)

1. **Setup**: 
   - Test accounts: Teacher, Admin, Parent (if available)

2. **Actions**:
   - Attempt to access `/teacher/students` with each role
   - Try direct navigation to student profile URLs

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Teacher: Full access granted
   - ✅ Admin: Access denied (appropriate redirect/error)
   - ✅ Parent: Access denied (appropriate redirect/error)
   - ✅ Unauthenticated: Redirect to login

### Test Scenario 8: Performance & Scalability
**Validates**: Performance goals (<300ms page load, <100ms API response)

1. **Setup**: 
   - Student with 20+ observations
   - Network throttling tools (optional)

2. **Actions**:
   - Measure page load times
   - Test observation list pagination
   - Create new observations and measure response time

3. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Student list loads in <300ms
   - ✅ Profile page loads in <300ms
   - ✅ Observation creation completes in <100ms
   - ✅ Pagination works smoothly with large observation counts

### Error Handling Validation

#### Invalid Student Access
- **Test**: Teacher tries to access student from different school
- **Expected**: 403 Forbidden or appropriate error message

#### Empty Observation Submission
- **Test**: Submit observation form with blank/empty note
- **Expected**: Validation error, form not submitted

#### Network Failure Handling
- **Test**: Disconnect network during observation creation
- **Expected**: Appropriate error message, no partial data corruption

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Teacher can view assigned student list
- [ ] Teacher can access individual student profiles
- [ ] Teacher can create observations for students
- [ ] Teacher can edit existing observations
- [ ] No deletion capability present
- [ ] Multi-teacher collaboration works

**Security & Access Control**:
- [ ] Only Teachers can access student profiles
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation enforced
- [ ] Cross-school data access prevented
- [ ] Proper authentication required

**User Experience**:

- [ ] Loading states during data fetch

**Data Integrity**:
- [ ] Observations linked to correct students/teachers
- [ ] Timestamps accurate for creation/modification
- [ ] Database constraints prevent invalid data
- [ ] Multi-tenant scoping prevents data leaks

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues discovered:
1. **Database**: Observations table can be dropped safely (new table)
2. **Routes**: Remove `/teacher/students` route protection
3. **Components**: Disable observation forms, show read-only message
4. **Revert**: Git rollback to previous stable state

## Post-Deployment Verification

**24 Hours After Deploy**:
- Monitor error logs for Teacher module access issues
- Verify observation creation success rates
- Check database query performance
- Validate multi-tenant data isolation

**1 Week After Deploy**:
- Review Teacher feedback on observation workflow
- Analyze usage patterns for performance optimization
- Verify no cross-tenant data access in logs
- Plan next iteration based on usage data
