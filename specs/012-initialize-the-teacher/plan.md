# Implementation Plan: Initialize Teacher Module

**Branch**: `012-initialize-the-teacher` | **Date**: October 2, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/012-initialize-the-teacher/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Initialize Teacher Module with dedicated routes and navigation separate from Admin functionality. Create Teacher Dashboard at `/teacher/dashboard` and Student Roster at `/teacher/students` with role-based access control. Implementation focuses on creating the module structure with empty pages initially, not full functionality. Multi-class teacher support with unified student view including active/inactive status indicators.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Next.js 15 (App Router) and React 19  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Auth.js, Drizzle ORM  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with existing multi-tenant schema  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Web application (server-side rendered)
**Project Type**: web - Next.js application with frontend+backend  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms page load, responsive UI for 100+ concurrent users  
**Constraints**: Must follow existing RBAC patterns, multi-tenant data isolation  
**Scale/Scope**: Initial module setup - 2 routes, basic navigation, empty page components
**User Context**: Only module structure with empty pages needed initially, not full page implementations

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Micro Function Gate
- [x] Functions must be small, composable, and focused on one responsibility
- [x] No single file should contain excessive unrelated logic
- [x] Route handlers and page components are kept minimal with logic extracted to separate files

### Client Directive Gate
- [x] `use client` must only appear in the **most child component** that truly requires it
- [x] Avoid marking entire routes/pages as client unless absolutely necessary
- [x] Server components are preferred for data fetching and initial rendering

### Component Reuse Gate
- [x] Before creating a new component, confirm one doesn't already exist in the scoped `components/` folder
- [x] Shared UI components should live in the global `ui/` library folder
- [x] shadcn/ui and Tailwind used consistently across all components

### Multi-Tenant Security Gate
- [x] All database queries are scoped by tenant (school/team)
- [x] RBAC enforcement is implemented at both middleware and route level
- [x] User actions are logged to `access_logs` with proper tenant isolation
- [x] Session management handles role changes appropriately

### Database Efficiency Gate
- [x] Only query the database when necessary
- [x] Avoid redundant queries; use caching or state management when possible
- [x] Drizzle ORM is used instead of raw SQL unless performance requires otherwise
- [x] Query performance is tested under realistic multi-tenant load

### No Hardcoding Gate
- [x] All configurable values use `const` or `enum` declarations
- [x] No hardcoded strings, roles, statuses, or business logic values in implementation
- [x] Configuration is externalized and environment-appropriate

### Specification-First Gate
- [x] Clear specifications exist before implementation begins
- [x] All features have documented requirements and acceptance criteria
- [x] Implementation follows approved specifications and design documents

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Next.js application) - follows existing montessori-app architecture

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks focused on minimal module structure (empty pages only)
- Route structure creation tasks [P]
- Basic page component tasks [P]
- Navigation integration tasks
- RBAC middleware integration tasks
- Empty state component tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure first: Route groups, layouts, middleware
- Pages second: Basic page components with empty content
- Navigation third: Teacher-specific menu and routing
- Testing last: Route protection and empty state verification
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Scope Adjustment for User Request**:
- Focus on module structure and empty pages only
- Defer data fetching, API implementation, and full functionality
- Minimal components with placeholder content
- Basic navigation and role-based access

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md (reduced scope)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
