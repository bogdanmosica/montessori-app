## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description provided: Teacher Module initialization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Teachers, Admins, Parents
   ‚Üí Actions: login, navigate, view students, access control
   ‚Üí Data: student rosters, teacher assignments
   ‚Üí Constraints: role-based access, teacher-specific scope
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Empty state behavior for teachers with no students]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multi-class teacher assignment support]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Historical/inactive student visibility]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Dashboard content - metrics vs welcome screen]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for teacher login and navigation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements are testable and scoped to teacher functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Teacher assignments, student rosters, role permissions
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties marked for clarification"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT teachers need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: When a Teacher has no assigned students, what should the Student Roster page display? ‚Üí A: Show empty state message with instructions to contact admin
- Q: Can a Teacher be assigned to multiple classes/groups of students? ‚Üí A: Multiple classes - Teacher can be assigned to several different class groups
- Q: Should Teachers see historical or inactive students in their roster? ‚Üí A: Include inactive - show both active and inactive students with status indicators
- Q: What should the Teacher Dashboard display initially? ‚Üí A: Student metrics overview (attendance, progress summaries)
- Q: For the Teacher Dashboard metrics, what level of detail should attendance summaries show? ‚Üí A: minimal (daily totals only, no individual session breakdowns)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Teacher in the Montessori school system, I need my own dedicated workspace where I can log in, see my dashboard, and access my student roster. This is separate from the administrative functions and provides me with the specific tools I need for my classroom management without overwhelming me with system-wide administration features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with Teacher role exists in the system, **When** they log in successfully, **Then** they are directed to the Teacher Dashboard at `/teacher/dashboard`
2. **Given** a Teacher is on their dashboard, **When** they navigate to the Student Roster, **Then** they can view only the students assigned to their class
3. **Given** a Teacher tries to access an Admin-only route, **When** they attempt navigation, **Then** they are redirected to `/unauthorized`
4. **Given** an Admin or Parent user, **When** they attempt to access Teacher routes, **Then** they are denied access and redirected appropriately
5. **Given** a Teacher is viewing their Student Roster, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see only students linked to their teacher account

### Edge Cases
- When a Teacher has no assigned students, the Student Roster page displays an empty state message with instructions to contact administration for student assignments
- Teachers can be assigned to multiple classes/groups, and the Student Roster displays all students from all assigned classes in a unified view
- Student Roster includes both active and inactive students with clear status indicators to distinguish enrollment status
- Teacher Dashboard displays student metrics overview including attendance summaries and progress data for all assigned students

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST recognize and enforce Teacher role permissions through middleware
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide dedicated Teacher routes under `/teacher/*` path structure
- **FR-003**: System MUST redirect Teachers to `/teacher/dashboard` upon successful login
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a Teacher Dashboard page accessible only to Teacher role users
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a Student Roster page at `/teacher/students` for viewing assigned students
- **FR-006**: System MUST scope Student Roster data to only students assigned to the logged-in Teacher
- **FR-012**: System MUST display empty state message with admin contact instructions when Teacher has no assigned students
- **FR-013**: System MUST display both active and inactive students in the roster with clear status indicators
- **FR-014**: Teacher Dashboard MUST display student metrics overview including attendance summaries (daily totals only) and progress data
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent non-Teacher users (Admin, Parent) from accessing Teacher routes
- **FR-008**: System MUST redirect Teachers attempting to access Admin routes to `/unauthorized`
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide Teacher-specific navigation menu for Teacher route pages
- **FR-010**: System MUST use role constants/enums instead of hardcoded role strings
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain separation between Teacher and Admin functionalities

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Teacher**: User with Teacher role, has assigned students, accesses Teacher-specific routes
- **Student Roster**: Collection of students assigned to a specific Teacher for classroom management
- **Role Permissions**: Access control rules that determine which routes and features each user type can access
- **Teacher Assignment**: Many-to-many relationship between Teachers and classes/students, allowing Teachers to manage multiple class groups simultaneously
