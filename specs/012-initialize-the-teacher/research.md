# Research: Teacher Module Implementation

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Next.js App Router Structure
**Rationale**: Follow existing montessori-app architecture with App Router for consistent routing patterns and server-side rendering capabilities.
**Alternatives considered**: Pages Router (deprecated), standalone React app (increases complexity)

### Decision: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Integration  
**Rationale**: Leverage existing middleware and authentication patterns to ensure Teacher role is properly enforced without duplicating security logic.
**Alternatives considered**: New authentication system (unnecessary complexity), route-level only checks (insufficient security)

### Decision: Minimal Initial Implementation
**Rationale**: User specifically requested only module structure with empty pages, not full functionality implementation.
**Alternatives considered**: Full feature implementation (not requested), component library only (insufficient for navigation)

### Decision: Multi-Tenant Data Scoping
**Rationale**: Must follow existing database patterns to ensure Teachers only see their assigned students within their school/tenant.
**Alternatives considered**: Global student access (security violation), new tenant model (unnecessary complexity)

## Implementation Patterns

### Next.js Route Groups
- Use `(teacher)` route group to organize Teacher-specific routes
- Leverage App Router's layout inheritance for Teacher navigation
- Server components for initial page loads, client components only for interactivity

### Component Organization  
- Page-scoped components in `app/teacher/*/components/`
- Shared UI components remain in global `components/ui/`
- Follow existing shadcn/ui and Tailwind patterns

### Database Integration
- Extend existing Drizzle ORM schemas for teacher-student relationships
- Use existing multi-tenant scoping patterns
- Query optimization for teacher dashboard metrics (minimal data)

### Security Integration
- Middleware role checking using existing RBAC system
- Session management integration with Auth.js
- Access logging to existing `access_logs` table

## Dependencies Analysis

### Existing Dependencies (Reuse)
- Next.js 15 + React 19: Core framework
- shadcn/ui + Tailwind: UI consistency  
- Auth.js: Authentication and sessions
- Drizzle ORM: Database operations
- TypeScript: Type safety

### New Dependencies (None Required)
All required functionality can be implemented using existing project dependencies.

## Integration Points

### Middleware Integration
- Extend existing role checking to include Teacher role
- Route protection for `/teacher/*` paths
- Redirect logic for unauthorized access

### Database Schema Extensions
- Teacher-student assignment relationships
- Student status indicators (active/inactive)
- Access logging for Teacher actions

### Navigation Integration
- Teacher-specific navigation menu
- Role-based menu rendering
- Consistent layout with existing patterns

## Performance Considerations

### Server-Side Rendering
- Teacher Dashboard metrics: Server-rendered for initial load
- Student roster: Server-rendered with pagination if needed
- Minimal client-side JavaScript for static content

### Database Optimization
- Efficient queries for teacher-student relationships
- Index optimization for multi-tenant teacher queries
- Minimal data loading for empty page implementations

### Caching Strategy
- Server-side caching for teacher assignments
- Static generation where possible
- Session-based caching for role information
