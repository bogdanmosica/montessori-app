# Teacher Module: Data Integration Complete

## Summary
Successfully integrated real student data into the Teacher module, replacing empty states with live data from the database.

## What Was Created

### 1. Database Schema (`lib/db/schema/teachers.ts`)
- ✅ `teachers` table - Links users with teacher role to schools
- ✅ `teacher_student_assignments` table - Many-to-many relationship between teachers and students
- ✅ Proper relations and TypeScript types

**Migration**: `lib/db/migrations/0007_fancy_starjammers.sql`

### 2. Seed Script (`scripts/seed-teacher-students.ts`)
Creates test data for teacher@test.com:
- 6 students (5 active, 1 inactive)
- 2 class groups (Morning Class, Afternoon Class)
- Teacher-student assignments

**Run**: `npx tsx scripts/seed-teacher-students.ts`

### 3. Teacher Service (`lib/services/teacher-service.ts`)
Two main functions:
- `getTeacherDashboardData(userId)` - Fetches dashboard metrics and recent students
- `getTeacherStudentRoster(userId, filters?)` - Fetches complete student roster with optional filtering

### 4. Updated Pages
- ✅ `app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx` - Shows real metrics and student list
- ✅ `app/teacher/students/page.tsx` - Shows complete student roster with details

## Test Data Created

### Students
1. **Emma Johnson** (Female, Age 6) - Morning Class - ACTIVE
2. **Liam Williams** (Male, Age 7) - Morning Class - ACTIVE
3. **Olivia Brown** (Female, Age 5) - Afternoon Class - ACTIVE
4. **Noah Davis** (Male, Age 7) - Morning Class - ACTIVE
5. **Ava Miller** (Female, Age 6) - Afternoon Class - INACTIVE
6. **Ethan Wilson** (Male, Age 6) - Morning Class - ACTIVE

### Statistics
- Total Students: 6

- Class Groups: 2 (Morning Class, Afternoon Class)

## Dashboard Features

- Color-coded badges (Active = primary, Inactive = secondary)

## Student Roster Features

### Summary Cards

- Active students count
- Inactive students count

### Complete Student List
Each student shows:
- Full name
- Enrollment status badge
- Class group
- Age (calculated from date of birth)
- Gender

## Technical Details

### Database Queries
- Uses Drizzle ORM with proper relations
- Filters by teacher ID and active assignments
- Multi-tenant safe (scoped by school)

### Server-Side Rendering
- Both pages use async server components
- Data fetched at request time
- Session validation integrated
- Automatic redirects for unauthorized access

### Security
- Session validation on every page
- Teacher record verification
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- RBAC enforcement via middleware

## How to Test

### As Teacher User
1. Log in with `teacher@test.com` / `teacher123`
2. Navigate to `/teacher/dashboard`
3. **Should see:**
   - Metrics: 6 total, 5 active, 1 inactive
   - List of 5 students with badges
4. Click "My Students" in navigation
5. **Should see:**
   - 2 class groups
   - All 6 students with full details
   - Age calculated correctly
   - Status badges

### Re-run Seed
To reset test data:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-teacher-students.ts
```

Script is idempotent - won't create duplicates if run multiple times.

## Database Structure

```
users (teacher@test.com)
  ↓
teachers (teacher record)
  ↓
teacher_student_assignments
  ↓
children (students)
```

## Next Steps

### Future Enhancements
1. **Filtering** - Add status and class group filters to roster
2. **Search** - Search students by name
3. **Student Details** - Individual student profile pages
4. **Attendance** - Track student attendance
5. **Progress Reports** - Generate student progress reports

## Build Status
✅ Database migration applied
✅ Seed data created successfully
✅ Pages render with real data
✅ Build compiles successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors
