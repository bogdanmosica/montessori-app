# RBAC Update: Admin Access to Teacher Routes

## Change Summary
Modified middleware to allow Admin users to access Teacher routes in addition to Teacher users.

## Rationale
- **Testing**: Admins can test teacher functionality without switching accounts
- **Management**: Admins can view teacher interface for support and training
- **Development**: Simplifies development workflow during feature implementation

## Implementation
**File**: `middleware.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
if (user.role !== UserRole.TEACHER) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/unauthorized', request.url));
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (user.role !== UserRole.TEACHER && user.role !== UserRole.ADMIN) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/unauthorized', request.url));
}
```

## Access Matrix

| User Role | `/teacher/dashboard` | `/teacher/students` | `/admin/dashboard` |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Admin     | ✅ Allow            | ✅ Allow            | ✅ Allow          |
| Teacher   | ✅ Allow            | ✅ Allow            | ❌ Deny           |
| Parent    | ❌ Deny             | ❌ Deny             | ❌ Deny           |
| Guest     | ❌ Deny (→ /sign-in)| ❌ Deny (→ /sign-in)| ❌ Deny (→ /sign-in)|

## Testing

### As Admin User
1. Log in with admin credentials
2. Navigate to `/teacher/dashboard` → ✅ Success
3. Navigate to `/teacher/students` → ✅ Success
4. Both pages accessible with admin account

### As Teacher User
1. Log in with teacher credentials: `teacher@test.com` / `teacher123`
2. Navigate to `/teacher/dashboard` → ✅ Success
3. Navigate to `/teacher/students` → ✅ Success
4. Navigate to `/admin/dashboard` → ❌ Redirected to `/unauthorized`

### As Parent User
1. Navigate to `/teacher/dashboard` → ❌ Redirected to `/unauthorized`
2. Navigate to `/admin/dashboard` → ❌ Redirected to `/unauthorized`

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Production Recommendation**: For production environments, consider:
- Removing admin access to teacher routes if strict role separation is required
- Adding audit logging to track when admins access teacher routes
- Implementing a "view as" feature instead of direct access

## Audit Trail
All access attempts are logged via `logAccessAttempt()` with:
- User ID
- Team/School ID
- Route accessed
- Success/failure status
- IP address and user agent

## Rollback
To restore strict teacher-only access:
```typescript
if (user.role !== UserRole.TEACHER) {
  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/unauthorized', request.url));
}
```
