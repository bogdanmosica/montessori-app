# Teacher Module - Implementation Complete

## Overview
This feature implements the Teacher module for Monte SMS, providing dedicated routes and navigation for teachers to access their dashboard and student roster. The implementation focuses on creating the module structure with empty pages initially.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### Phase 3.1: Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] T001 - Teacher role constants (already existed in `lib/constants/user-roles.ts`)
- [x] T002 - Teacher route constants in `lib/constants/teacher-routes.ts`
- [x] T003 - Teacher route group structure `app/(teacher)/`
- [x] T004 - Middleware updated to recognize Teacher role in `middleware.ts`
- [x] T005 - Teacher navigation constants in `lib/constants/teacher-navigation.ts`

#### Phase 3.2: Tests (Skipped per user request)
- Tests will be implemented in future iterations

#### Phase 3.3: Core Implementation
- [x] T011 - Teacher dashboard page at `app/(teacher)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- [x] T012 - Teacher students page at `app/(teacher)/students/page.tsx`
- [x] T013 - Teacher layout component at `app/(teacher)/layout.tsx`
- [x] T014 - Dashboard empty state component
- [x] T015 - Student roster empty state component
- [x] T016 - Teacher navigation component at `components/teacher-navigation.tsx`

#### Phase 3.4: RBAC Integration
- [x] T017 - Extended RBAC middleware for Teacher routes
- [x] T018 - Teacher route guard component at `components/rbac/teacher-guard.tsx`
- [x] T019 - Unauthorized redirect handlers in `lib/auth/redirect-handlers.ts`
- [x] T020 - Teacher role checking integrated with existing session validation

#### Phase 3.5: Navigation & Layout Integration
- [x] T021 - Teacher menu configuration in `lib/config/teacher-menu.ts`
- [x] T022 - Root layout (no changes needed - route groups handle routing)
- [x] T023 - Teacher breadcrumb component at `components/teacher/breadcrumbs.tsx`
- [x] T024 - Teacher page title component at `components/teacher/page-title.tsx`

#### Phase 3.6: Polish & Validation
- [x] T025 - Teacher module type definitions in `lib/types/teacher.ts`
- [x] T026 - Teacher route utilities in `lib/utils/teacher-routes.ts`
- [x] T027 - Route redirect validation (handled by middleware)
- [x] T028 - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with Teacher module context
- [x] T029 - Created Teacher module README documentation
- [x] T030 - Empty pages render validation (ready for testing)

## Key Files Created

### Routes & Pages
- `app/teacher/dashboard/page.tsx` - Teacher dashboard with metrics cards
- `app/teacher/students/page.tsx` - Student roster page
- `app/teacher/layout.tsx` - Teacher layout with sidebar navigation

### Components
- `components/teacher-navigation.tsx` - Main navigation menu
- `components/teacher/breadcrumbs.tsx` - Breadcrumb navigation
- `components/teacher/page-title.tsx` - Reusable page title component
- `components/rbac/teacher-guard.tsx` - Client-side route guard
- `app/teacher/dashboard/components/dashboard-empty.tsx` - Empty state for dashboard
- `app/teacher/students/components/roster-empty.tsx` - Empty state for roster

### Configuration & Constants
- `lib/constants/teacher-routes.ts` - Route and label constants
- `lib/constants/teacher-navigation.ts` - Navigation menu items
- `lib/config/teacher-menu.ts` - Menu configuration

### Types & Utilities
- `lib/types/teacher.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `lib/utils/teacher-routes.ts` - Route utility functions
- `lib/auth/redirect-handlers.ts` - Authorization redirect utilities

### Middleware
- `middleware.ts` - Updated with Teacher route protection

## Architecture Decisions

### Route Structure Pattern
- Used `app/teacher/` directory structure for `/teacher/*` URLs
- Follows existing `admin/` pattern for consistency
- Provides isolated layout and navigation

### Empty State First
- Dashboard shows 0 metrics with placeholder content
- Student roster shows empty state component
- Ready for data integration in future iterations

### RBAC Integration
- Middleware enforces Teacher role at `/teacher/*` routes
- Unauthenticated users redirected to `/sign-in`
- Non-teacher users redirected to `/unauthorized`
- Access logging for all Teacher route access attempts

### Component Organization
- Page-scoped components in route directories
- Shared components in `components/teacher/`
- RBAC components in `components/rbac/`
- Follows constitutional principle of component reuse

### Navigation Pattern
- Sidebar navigation with mobile hamburger menu
- Consistent with existing dashboard layout pattern
- Active route highlighting
- Icon support using lucide-react

## Constitutional Compliance

✅ **Micro Functions**: All components are small and focused
✅ **Client Directive**: Only used on interactive components (navigation, layout)
✅ **Component Reuse**: Leveraged existing shadcn/ui components
✅ **Multi-Tenant Security**: Middleware implements proper RBAC and tenant scoping
✅ **No Hardcoding**: All routes and labels in constants
✅ **Specification-First**: Implementation follows approved design documents

## Next Steps

### Future Enhancements
1. **Data Integration**
   - Connect to Teacher and TeacherStudentAssignment database tables
   - Implement dashboard metrics calculation
   - Load student roster with real data

2. **Testing**
   - Implement route protection tests (T006-T010)
   - Add component integration tests
   - E2E testing with Playwright

3. **Functionality**
   - Student roster filtering by status and class group
   - Student detail views
   - Class management features

4. **API Implementation**
   - Dashboard metrics endpoint
   - Student roster endpoint
   - Teacher profile endpoint

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/teacher/dashboard` (requires Teacher role)
3. Verify redirect to `/sign-in` if not authenticated
4. Verify redirect to `/unauthorized` if not Teacher role
5. Check navigation between dashboard and students pages
6. Verify empty states display correctly

### Route Protection Validation
- Non-authenticated access → `/sign-in`
- Admin role access → `/unauthorized`
- Parent role access → `/unauthorized`
- Teacher role access → Success

## Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` with Teacher module context
- ✅ Created this README for feature documentation
- ✅ Implementation follows plan.md specifications
