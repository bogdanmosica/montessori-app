4. **FilterControls** - Student and category filtering
5. **CreateAssignmentModal** - New assignment creation

**Features**:
- Optimistic UI updates
- Lock indicators on cards
- Empty state handling
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop)

### Phase 3.7: Page & Layout Integration ✅
- Main progress board page at `/teacher/progress-board`
- Loading states with skeleton UI
- Error boundaries with recovery options
- Empty state with onboarding
- Modal-based assignment creation

### Phase 3.8: Middleware & Security ✅
- Teacher route protection already in middleware
- Access logging for all operations
- Multi-tenant data scoping enforced
- Audit trail for progress changes
- Lock cleanup job created

### Phase 3.9: Performance & Polish ✅
- Optimistic updates in UI
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Database query optimization (composite indexes)
- Loading states and error boundaries
- Batch operation support

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Multi-Tenant Security
- All queries scoped by `schoolId` and `teacherId`
- Middleware-level RBAC enforcement
- Row-level security through query helpers

### Card Locking System
- 5-minute TTL prevents stuck locks
- Database-level lock tracking
- Automatic cleanup job
- Visual lock indicators in UI

### Drag-and-Drop
- React DnD with HTML5 backend
- Touch device support
- Optimistic UI updates
- Server validation on drop

### Performance
- Server-side rendering for initial load
- Client-side state management
- Composite database indexes
- Batch operations for efficiency

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Run migrations (already applied)
pnpm drizzle-kit push

# Seed progress columns
npx tsx scripts/seed/progress-columns.ts
```

### 2. Test the Feature
1. Login as a teacher user
2. Navigate to `/teacher/progress-board`
3. Create lesson assignments
4. Test drag-and-drop functionality
5. Verify filtering works
6. Test with multiple concurrent users for locking

### 3. Setup Cron Job (Production)
Schedule the lock cleanup job to run every minute:
```bash
# Add to crontab or use a task scheduler
# */1 * * * * node lib/jobs/cleanup-expired-locks.js
```

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor database query performance
- Track API response times
- Measure drag-and-drop latency
- Check concurrent user handling
