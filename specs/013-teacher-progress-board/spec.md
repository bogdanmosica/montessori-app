# Feature Specification: Teacher Progress Board

**Feature Branch**: `013-teacher-progress-board`  
**Created**: October 2, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/teacher/progress-board page. Build the Kanban Progress Board in the Teacher Module of montessori-app. This board allows Teachers to track lesson progress for their students. Each card represents a lesson assigned to a student and can be moved across columns (progress statuses)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Kanban Progress Board for Teachers to track lesson progress
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Teachers, Students
   ‚Üí Actions: track progress, drag/drop cards, filter board
   ‚Üí Data: lessons, students, progress status
   ‚Üí Constraints: teacher-only access, visual board format
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What if teacher has no lessons assigned yet?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can cards exist without linked students?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are lesson definitions predefined by admins or teacher-created?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are progress columns configurable or fixed?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: teacher accesses board, views cards, moves them between columns
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Access control, board display, card management, persistence
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí LessonProgress, Lesson, Child, Teacher
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarifications needed"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: Who creates and manages the lesson definitions that Teachers assign to students? ‚Üí A: Both - Admins create templates, Teachers can customize or create new ones
- Q: What level of column configurability should the progress board support? ‚Üí A: Admin configures column templates, Teachers select from presets
- Q: What should the progress board show when a Teacher has no lesson assignments yet? ‚Üí A: Empty board with instructions on how to create first assignment
- Q: How should the system handle when two Teachers try to update the same student's lesson progress simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Lock cards during editing, prevent concurrent access
- Q: Should the system support lesson cards that aren't assigned to specific students? ‚Üí A: Yes - Teachers can create template/planning cards without students

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Teacher in the montessori-app system, I need a visual Kanban board to track lesson progress for my students. Each lesson-student pairing appears as a card that I can move between progress columns (Not Started, In Progress, Completed) to maintain an up-to-date view of where each student stands with their assigned lessons.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in Teacher, **When** I navigate to `/teacher/progress-board`, **Then** I see a Kanban board with progress columns and cards representing student-lesson pairs
2. **Given** I have cards on the progress board, **When** I drag a card from "Not Started" to "In Progress", **Then** the card moves to the new column and the change is saved persistently
3. **Given** I have multiple students and lessons on my board, **When** I apply a filter by student name, **Then** only cards for that student are displayed
4. **Given** I have multiple lesson categories, **When** I filter by lesson category, **Then** only cards matching that category are shown
5. **Given** I am viewing the progress board, **When** I create a new lesson assignment for a student, **Then** a new card appears in the "Not Started" column

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a Teacher has no lessons assigned yet? Empty board displays with instructions for creating first assignment
- How does the system handle if a lesson or student is deleted while cards exist on the board?
- What occurs if two teachers try to update the same lesson progress simultaneously? Cards are locked during editing to prevent conflicts
- Can a card exist without a linked student (generic lesson)? Yes - Teachers can create template/planning cards for lesson preparation before student assignment

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST restrict access to the progress board to users with Teacher role only
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a Kanban board where Teachers can select from predefined admin-configured column template presets but cannot modify column names or create custom columns (default template: Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- **FR-003**: System MUST represent each lesson assignment as a draggable card showing lesson title, current status, and student name (or "Unassigned" for template cards)
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow Teachers to drag and drop cards between progress columns
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist card position changes using optimistic updates with immediate server synchronization when moved between columns
- **FR-005b**: System MUST lock cards during editing to prevent concurrent access conflicts
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide filtering capabilities by student name
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide filtering capabilities by lesson category 
- **FR-008**: System MUST display an empty board with clear instructions on how to create the first lesson assignment when no assignments exist
- **FR-009**: System MUST track timestamps for when lesson progress status changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent unauthorized access and show appropriate error for non-Teacher users
- **FR-011**: System MUST support both admin-created lesson templates and teacher-customized lesson definitions when creating assignment cards
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow Teachers to select from admin-configured column template presets for their progress board layout
- **FR-013**: System MUST support creation of template/planning cards without specific student assignments for lesson preparation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **LessonProgress**: Represents the relationship between a lesson and optionally a student with current progress status, including lessonId reference, studentId reference (nullable for template cards), status enum (not_started, in_progress, completed), and created/updated timestamps
- **Lesson**: Represents a learning activity or curriculum item that can be assigned to students, including both admin-created templates and teacher-customized definitions
- **Child**: Represents a student in the system who can have lessons assigned to them
- **Teacher**: Represents the educator user who manages and tracks lesson progress for their assigned students
