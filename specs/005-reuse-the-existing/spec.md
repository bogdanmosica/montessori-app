# Feature Specification: Reusable Admin Navigation Bar

**Feature Branch**: `005-reuse-the-existing`  
**Created**: September 26, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Reuse the existing component Navigation Bar from old dashboard page and reuse it in all admin pages, but with different urls. The urls should be the quick links found in each of the admin page in the last bottom section."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract key concepts: reuse navigation component, apply to admin pages, use quick link URLs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: admin users, navigation actions, page routing, UI consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí None identified - requirements are clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: admin navigating between pages via consistent navigation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Navigation items, admin pages, routing paths
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements are clear and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What should happen when a user clicks on a navigation link for a page that doesn't exist yet (e.g., Enrollments, Payments, Reports)? ‚Üí A: Show a "Coming Soon" placeholder page with navigation intact
- Q: Where should the navigation bar be positioned on each admin page? ‚Üí A: Navigation bar is the most top header
- Q: What should happen when a user without proper admin permissions tries to access admin pages via the navigation? ‚Üí A: Redirect to login page with error message

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a school administrator using the Montessori admin system, I want to have consistent navigation available on all admin pages so that I can quickly access any admin function without having to return to the main dashboard every time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an admin user is on the admin dashboard page, **When** they see the quick actions section, **Then** the same navigation links should be available as a persistent navigation bar on all other admin pages
2. **Given** an admin user is on the applications page, **When** they want to access payments, **Then** they should be able to click a navigation link without returning to the dashboard first
3. **Given** an admin user is on any admin page, **When** they view the navigation bar, **Then** it should show the current active page and allow navigation to Applications, Enrollments, Payments, and Reports
4. **Given** an admin user navigates between admin pages using the navigation bar, **When** they land on a new page, **Then** the navigation should update to show the current page as active

### Edge Cases
- How does navigation behave on mobile devices with limited screen space?
- When a user clicks on a navigation link for a non-existent page (Enrollments, Payments, Reports), system displays a "Coming Soon" placeholder page while maintaining the navigation bar structure
- When a user without proper admin permissions tries to access admin pages via navigation, system redirects to login page with error message

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a consistent navigation bar on all admin pages (dashboard, applications, enrollments, payments, reports)
- **FR-002**: Navigation bar MUST include links to Applications (/admin/applications), Enrollments (/admin/enrollments), Payments (/admin/payments), and Reports (/admin/reports)  
- **FR-003**: Navigation bar MUST visually indicate the currently active page to users
- **FR-004**: Navigation bar MUST be positioned as the topmost header element on all admin pages with consistent visual style and layout
- **FR-005**: Navigation links MUST be functional and route users to the correct admin pages
- **FR-006**: System MUST reuse the existing quick actions pattern from admin dashboard page (/admin/dashboard lines 308-330) for navigation component consistency
- **FR-007**: Navigation bar MUST be responsive and work on both desktop (‚â•768px) and mobile devices (<768px) with appropriate layout adaptations
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve any existing page-specific functionality when adding the navigation bar
- **FR-009**: System MUST display "Coming Soon" placeholder pages with navigation intact for non-existent admin pages (Enrollments, Payments, Reports)
- **FR-011**: System MUST redirect unauthorized users to login page with error message when they attempt to access admin pages via navigation

### Key Entities
- **Navigation Item**: Represents a link in the navigation bar with properties like URL, label, icon, and active state
- **Admin Page**: Represents each admin interface page that needs the navigation bar (dashboard, applications, enrollments, payments, reports)
- **Navigation Bar Component**: The reusable UI component that contains and displays all navigation items
