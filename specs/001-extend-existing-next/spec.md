# Feature Specification: Role-Based Access Control for Admin Routes

**Feature Branch**: `001-extend-existing-next`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Extend existing Next.js Auth + Teams implementation to support roles: Parent, Teacher, and Admin. In this phase, enforce role-based access only for Admins."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Completed: Feature description provides clear role-based access requirements
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Admin, Parent, Teacher users
   → Actions: Sign in, access admin routes, redirect unauthorized users
   → Data: User roles, session information
   → Constraints: Preserve existing design, update only topbar logo
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects clearly defined in user stories and acceptance criteria
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flows identified for Admin access and unauthorized handling
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → User roles and session data identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clear, no implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: How should user roles be assigned in Monte SMS? → A: Admins assign roles to other users through admin interface
- Q: What should be the default role for new users? → A: Default to Parent role for new users
- Q: When should sessions be invalidated after role changes? → A: On next page navigation or refresh
- Q: What level of audit logging detail is needed? → A: Basic: user ID, timestamp, route accessed, success/failure
- Q: What should the new topbar logo be? → A: just a simple school logo

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Monte SMS user, I need role-based access control so that Admins can securely access administrative functions while Teachers and Parents are appropriately restricted from sensitive school management areas.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an Admin user who has signed in, **When** I navigate to any `/admin/*` route, **Then** I should be granted access to view the admin content
2. **Given** I am a Parent or Teacher user who has signed in, **When** I attempt to access any `/admin/*` route, **Then** I should be redirected to `/unauthorized` page
3. **Given** I am any authenticated user, **When** I view my session context, **Then** my role (Admin, Teacher, or Parent) should be visible and accurate
4. **Given** I am any user browsing the application, **When** I view the interface, **Then** the design, fonts, and colors should remain unchanged except for the updated topbar logo (replaced with a simple school logo)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's role changes while they have an active session? Session should be invalidated and user re-authenticated on their next page navigation or refresh.
- How does the system handle users without assigned roles? New users default to Parent role; existing users without roles are treated as having Parent permissions.
- What happens if someone tries to directly access protected admin content via API? API endpoints should also enforce role-based restrictions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST define user roles as enumerated constants (Admin, Teacher, Parent) without hardcoded string values
- **FR-002**: System MUST store role information in user sessions and make it accessible to authentication middleware
- **FR-003**: System MUST protect all routes matching `/admin/*` pattern to allow access only to Admin role users
- **FR-004**: System MUST redirect non-Admin users attempting to access `/admin/*` routes to `/unauthorized` page
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve existing visual design including fonts, colors, and layout while updating only the topbar logo to a simple school logo
- **FR-006**: System MUST invalidate existing user sessions when role assignments change, taking effect on the user's next page navigation or refresh
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all access attempts to protected admin routes for audit compliance, capturing user ID, timestamp, route accessed, and success/failure status
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain session role information consistently across page navigations and refreshes
- **FR-009**: System MUST display appropriate unauthorized access messaging on `/unauthorized` page
- **FR-010**: System MUST ensure role-based restrictions apply to both client-side routing and server-side API access
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow Admin users to assign and modify roles for other users through the admin interface
- **FR-012**: System MUST default new users to Parent role upon account creation

### Key Entities
- **User Role**: Enumerated values representing user permissions (Admin, Teacher, Parent) with clear access level definitions
- **Session Context**: Extended user session data that includes role information and authentication status
- **Protected Route**: Admin-only routes that require role validation before access is granted
- **Access Log Entry**: Audit record of attempts to access protected resources including user ID, timestamp, route accessed, and success/failure status
