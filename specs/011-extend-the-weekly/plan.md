# Implementation Plan: Extend Weekly Trends Widget with Real Data

**Branch**: `011-extend-the-weekly` | **Date**: 2025-10-01 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/011-extend-the-weekly/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Replace dummy data in the Weekly Trends widget with real database data for comprehensive school activity tracking. The widget will display applications, enrollments, payments, staff activities, and events with configurable date ranges, zero-value handling, and proper multi-tenant security. Admin-only access with skeleton loading states and error handling.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with Next.js 15 (App Router)  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 19, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Auth.js  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL database with multi-tenant data isolation  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright (E2E)  
**Target Platform**: Web application (server-side rendered with client interactivity)
**Project Type**: web - Next.js application with server components and API routes  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms dashboard widget load time, real-time data aggregation  
**Constraints**: Multi-tenant security, RBAC enforcement, mobile-responsive design  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-school SaaS, 1000+ concurrent users, comprehensive activity metrics

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Micro Function Gate
- [x] Functions must be small, composable, and focused on one responsibility
- [x] No single file should contain excessive unrelated logic
- [x] Route handlers and page components are kept minimal with logic extracted to separate files

### Client Directive Gate
- [x] `use client` must only appear in the **most child component** that truly requires it
- [x] Avoid marking entire routes/pages as client unless absolutely necessary
- [x] Server components are preferred for data fetching and initial rendering

### Component Reuse Gate
- [x] Before creating a new component, confirm one doesn't already exist in the scoped `components/` folder
- [x] Shared UI components should live in the global `ui/` library folder
- [x] shadcn/ui and Tailwind used consistently across all components

### Multi-Tenant Security Gate
- [x] All database queries are scoped by tenant (school/team)
- [x] RBAC enforcement is implemented at both middleware and route level
- [x] User actions are logged to `access_logs` with proper tenant isolation
- [x] Session management handles role changes appropriately

### Database Efficiency Gate
- [x] Only query the database when necessary
- [x] Avoid redundant queries; use caching or state management when possible
- [x] Drizzle ORM is used instead of raw SQL unless performance requires otherwise
- [x] Query performance is tested under realistic multi-tenant load

### No Hardcoding Gate
- [x] All configurable values use `const` or `enum` declarations
- [x] No hardcoded strings, roles, statuses, or business logic values in implementation
- [x] Configuration is externalized and environment-appropriate

### Specification-First Gate
- [x] Clear specifications exist before implementation begins
- [x] All features have documented requirements and acceptance criteria
- [x] Implementation follows approved specifications and design documents

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Next.js application) - Web application with app router, server components, and API routes

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- API contract → contract test task for trends endpoint extension [P]
- Data model entities → database schema migration tasks [P]
- Widget component → component test and implementation tasks
- Integration scenarios from quickstart → E2E test tasks
- Performance benchmarks → load testing tasks

**Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Database Tasks** (5-7 tasks):
   - Create payment activity tracking schema
   - Create staff activity tracking schema  
   - Create event tracking schema
   - Add multi-tenant indexes for performance
   - Create database migration scripts

2. **API Tasks** (3-4 tasks):
   - Extend /api/admin/metrics endpoint for trends
   - Add trend data aggregation service
   - Implement caching for trend queries
   - Add comprehensive error handling

3. **Widget Tasks** (8-10 tasks):
   - Locate and analyze existing Weekly Trends widget
   - Create activity type selection component
   - Create date range picker component
   - Implement skeleton loading states
   - Update chart integration with real data
   - Add responsive design support

4. **Testing Tasks** (6-8 tasks):
   - Contract tests for trends API endpoint
   - Unit tests for data aggregation logic
   - Component tests for widget functionality
   - Integration tests for multi-tenant security
   - E2E tests for user scenarios
   - Performance tests for large datasets

5. **Security Tasks** (3-4 tasks):
   - Verify RBAC enforcement for widget access
   - Implement tenant scoping validation
   - Add audit logging for trend data access
   - Test cross-tenant data isolation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 1** (Parallel): Database schema and API contract tests
- **Phase 2** (Sequential): Database migrations and API implementation  
- **Phase 3** (Parallel): Widget components and unit tests
- **Phase 4** (Sequential): Integration and security testing
- **Phase 5** (Final): E2E testing and performance validation

**Task Dependencies**:
- Widget tasks depend on API implementation
- Integration tests depend on widget completion
- Performance tests depend on full feature implementation
- Security tests run throughout all phases

**Parallel Execution Markers**:
- Database schema tasks [P] - independent table creation
- Component test tasks [P] - isolated component testing
- Unit test tasks [P] - independent business logic testing
- Contract validation tasks [P] - API endpoint testing

**Estimated Output**: 28-32 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Quality Gates**:
- All contract tests must pass before widget development
- Multi-tenant security validation required before release
- Performance benchmarks must meet <200ms response time
- E2E scenarios must validate all user stories

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
