## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: When no data exists for the past 7 days (no applications or enrollments), how should the Weekly Trends widget display this state? ‚Üí A: Show zeros on the chart (0 applications, 0 enrollments for each day)
- Q: What additional metrics should the Weekly Trends widget support beyond applications and enrollments? ‚Üí A: Add all school activity types (payments, staff, events)
- Q: Should the Weekly Trends widget allow configurable time windows or remain fixed at 7 days? ‚Üí A: Allow custom date range selection
- Q: What should happen when a user's tenant/school context is unclear or missing during data retrieval? ‚Üí A: Log error silently and show generic message
- Q: How should the widget behave during data loading or when the database is temporarily unavailable? ‚Üí A: Show skeleton placeholder matching chart structure
- Q: What additional metrics should the Weekly Trends widget support beyond applications and enrollments? ‚Üí A: Add all school activity types (payments, staff, events)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a school administrator, I need to see accurate weekly activity trends on my dashboard to understand recent school activity patterns, track application volumes, and monitor enrollment progress. This helps me make informed decisions about staffing, capacity planning, and follow-up actions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an authenticated Admin user, **When** I navigate to the admin dashboard, **Then** I see the Weekly Trends widget displaying real data for applications and enrollments from the past 7 days
2. **Given** I am viewing the Weekly Trends widget, **When** the data loads, **Then** I see only data scoped to my school/tenant (not other schools' data)
3. **Given** I am on the admin dashboard, **When** I look at the Weekly Trends widget, **Then** I see a clear visual representation (chart) showing daily counts for the past 7 calendar days
4. **Given** I am a non-Admin user, **When** I try to access the admin dashboard, **Then** I cannot see the Weekly Trends widget due to role restrictions

### Edge Cases
- When no applications or enrollments exist for the selected date range, the chart displays zero values for each day
- When user's tenant/school context is unclear or missing, system logs error silently and displays generic "Unable to load data" message
- During data loading or database unavailability, widget displays skeleton placeholder matching the chart structure

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display real application data from the database instead of dummy/hardcoded values
- **FR-002**: System MUST display real enrollment data from the database instead of dummy/hardcoded values  
- **FR-003**: System MUST scope all data queries to the authenticated Admin's school/tenant
- **FR-004**: System MUST show data for the user-selected date range, defaulting to the past 7 calendar days
- **FR-005**: System MUST restrict widget visibility to users with Admin role only
- **FR-006**: System MUST aggregate daily counts for both applications received and new enrollments
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain the existing visual chart format and design consistency
- **FR-008**: System MUST display zero values on the chart for days with no applications or enrollments within the 7-day window
- **FR-009**: System MUST support comprehensive school activity metrics including applications, enrollments, payments, staff activities, and events
- **FR-009a**: System MUST allow users to select which activity types to display on the chart
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to select custom date ranges for trend analysis (not limited to 7 days)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Application**: Represents school applications with creation timestamps, status, and tenant association
- **Enrollment**: Represents student enrollments with enrollment dates, status, and tenant association  
- **WeeklyMetrics**: Aggregated daily counts of applications and enrollments for trend analysis
