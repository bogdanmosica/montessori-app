# Research: Weekly Trends Widget Implementation

## Technical Decisions

### Widget Data Sources
**Decision**: Use existing database tables (`applications`, `enrollments`) plus extend with `payments`, `staff_activities`, `events` tables  
**Rationale**: 
- Leverage existing multi-tenant data structure
- Maintain consistency with current database schema
- Support comprehensive activity metrics as specified
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Create dedicated `weekly_metrics` aggregation table (rejected: real-time data preferred)
- Use separate analytics database (rejected: adds complexity)

### API Endpoint Strategy
**Decision**: Extend existing `/api/admin/metrics` endpoint with new `trend` parameter  
**Rationale**: 
- Reuse existing RBAC and tenant scoping logic
- Maintain consistent API patterns
- Avoid proliferation of similar endpoints
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Create dedicated `/api/admin/trends` endpoint (rejected: duplicates security logic)
- Use GraphQL aggregation (rejected: not in current tech stack)

### Chart Library Integration
**Decision**: Use existing chart library (likely Recharts based on Next.js ecosystem)  
**Rationale**: 
- Maintain consistency with existing dashboard widgets
- shadcn/ui compatibility for theming
- TypeScript support and performance
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Chart.js (rejected: larger bundle size)
- D3.js direct (rejected: development complexity)

### Data Aggregation Strategy
**Decision**: Server-side aggregation using Drizzle ORM with optimized SQL queries  
**Rationale**: 
- Minimize client-side computation
- Leverage database performance for large datasets
- Maintain server-first architecture per constitution
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Client-side aggregation (rejected: performance and bundle size)
- Background job aggregation (rejected: adds infrastructure complexity)

### Multi-Tenant Security Pattern
**Decision**: Middleware-enforced tenant scoping with automatic query filtering  
**Rationale**: 
- Consistent with existing security architecture
- Prevents accidental data leaks
- Centralized enforcement point
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Application-level filtering (rejected: error-prone)
- Database-level RLS (rejected: not in current architecture)

### Error Handling Pattern
**Decision**: Silent logging with user-friendly fallback messages  
**Rationale**: 
- Prevents exposure of system internals
- Maintains dashboard usability during issues
- Supports troubleshooting via logs
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Detailed error messages (rejected: security concern)
- Retry mechanisms (rejected: may cascade failures)

### Loading State Implementation
**Decision**: Skeleton placeholders matching chart structure using shadcn/ui components  
**Rationale**: 
- Consistent with existing dashboard loading patterns
- Better UX than spinners for data visualizations
- Easy to implement with existing component library
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Loading spinners (rejected: less informative)
- Progressive loading (rejected: added complexity)

## Integration Patterns

### Existing Codebase Integration
- Locate current Weekly Trends widget in `app/admin/dashboard/components/`
- Identify current chart implementation and data structure
- Map existing dummy data fields to real database fields
- Preserve existing styling and layout patterns

### Database Schema Extensions
- Identify missing activity tables (`payments`, `staff_activities`, `events`)
- Ensure proper tenant_id foreign keys for multi-tenant scoping
- Add indexes for date-range queries with tenant filtering
- Maintain referential integrity with existing tables

### Authentication & Authorization
- Leverage existing middleware for Admin role verification
- Use current session management for tenant context
- Apply existing RBAC patterns for data access control
- Maintain audit logging patterns for compliance

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Use date range indexes with tenant_id for efficient filtering
- Implement query result caching for frequently accessed date ranges
- Batch multiple metric queries into single database round-trip
- Use connection pooling for concurrent dashboard loads

### Client-Side Performance
- Minimize JavaScript bundle impact with server components
- Use `use client` only for interactive chart components
- Implement efficient re-rendering patterns for date range changes
- Consider lazy loading for non-critical activity types

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Multi-tenant data leakage**: Mitigated by middleware enforcement and query scoping
2. **Performance degradation**: Mitigated by query optimization and caching strategies
3. **Breaking existing functionality**: Mitigated by incremental replacement approach

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Chart library incompatibility**: Mitigated by using existing proven libraries
2. **Missing activity data**: Mitigated by graceful zero-value handling
3. **Complex date range logic**: Mitigated by server-side date handling

### Low Priority Risks
1. **UI consistency issues**: Mitigated by using existing component patterns
2. **Browser compatibility**: Mitigated by Next.js build process
3. **Mobile responsiveness**: Mitigated by existing responsive design patterns
