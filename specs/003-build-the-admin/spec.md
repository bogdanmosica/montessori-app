# Feature Specification: Admin Applications Management

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-the-admin`  
**Created**: September 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build the /admin/applications feature for montessori-app. This page allows Admins to view and manage admission applications, approve/reject them, and create corresponding child and parent records."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Admin applications management system
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Admins, applicants (children/parents)
   ‚Üí Actions: view, filter, approve/reject applications, create child/parent records
   ‚Üí Data: applications, child profiles, parent profiles
   ‚Üí Constraints: Admin-only access, enum-based values
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] below
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Admin reviews and processes applications
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities: Applications, Child profiles, Parent profiles
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN: Spec has uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: How should the system handle applications where parent information is already in the database? ‚Üí A: Always link to existing parent profiles if email matches
- Q: How should the system handle applications with incomplete parent information? ‚Üí A: Allow approval but create parent profiles with partial data
- Q: What is the maximum number of parents that can be linked to each child? ‚Üí A: Exactly 2 parents maximum
- Q: What happens to rejected applications over time? ‚Üí A: Keep permanently in list with rejected status
- Q: Can Admins edit application data before approval? ‚Üí A: Application data is read-only, no editing allowed

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Montessori school administrator, I need to efficiently review and process student admission applications so I can manage the enrollment pipeline, make informed decisions about applicants, and seamlessly onboard approved families by creating their child and parent profiles in the system. Additionally, I need the ability to directly add children and their parents to the system without requiring an application submission.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as an Admin, **When** I navigate to `/admin/applications`, **Then** I see a list of all applications with their current status and key applicant information
2. **Given** I am viewing the applications list, **When** I filter by "pending" status, **Then** I see only applications awaiting my decision
3. **Given** I am reviewing a pending application, **When** I click "Approve", **Then** the system creates a child profile and prompts me to link parent information
4. **Given** I am reviewing a pending application, **When** I click "Reject", **Then** the application status updates to rejected without creating any profiles
5. **Given** I am viewing an application, **When** I click on it, **Then** I see the complete application details including all submitted information
6. **Given** I am on the applications page, **When** I search by applicant name, **Then** I see filtered results matching my search criteria
7. **Given** I am on the `/admin/applications` page, **When** I click "Add Child" button, **Then** I can directly create a new child profile with parent information without requiring an application

### Edge Cases
- Application data integrity maintained through read-only access

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST restrict access to `/admin/applications` to users with Admin role only
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a paginated list of all applications with status, applicant name, application date, and key details
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow filtering applications by status (pending, approved, rejected) using enum values
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide search functionality to find applications by child name, parent name, parent email, or application ID
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow Admins to view complete details of any individual application
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow Admins to approve pending applications, automatically updating status using enum values
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow Admins to reject pending applications, automatically updating status using enum values
- **FR-008**: System MUST create a new child profile when an application is approved, using application data
- **FR-009**: System MUST link to existing parent profiles when email matches, or create new parent profiles when no match found, when an application is approved
- **FR-010**: System MUST support linking exactly 2 parent profiles maximum to each child
- **FR-011**: System MUST prevent duplicate processing of the same application (idempotency)
- **FR-012**: System MUST log all approval/rejection actions for audit purposes
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow approval of applications with incomplete parent data and create parent profiles with available information
- **FR-014**: System MUST use only predefined enum values for all statuses and roles (no hardcoded strings)
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide clear visual indicators for application status (color-coded badges: green for approved, yellow for pending, red for rejected) and required actions
- **FR-016**: System MUST retain rejected applications permanently in the list with rejected status for audit purposes
- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain application data as read-only to preserve original submission integrity
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide an "Add Child" button on the `/admin/applications` page for direct child creation
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow Admins to create child profiles directly with parent information, bypassing the application process
- **FR-020**: System MUST apply the same parent linking rules (link existing by email, max 2 parents) for direct child creation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Application**: Represents a student admission request containing child information, parent details, preferred start date, and current processing status
- **Child Profile**: Student record created from approved applications, containing personal information, enrollment details, and links to parent profiles
- **Parent Profile**: Guardian information either created from application data or linked from existing profiles, containing contact details and relationship to child
