# Research: Admin Applications Management

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Decision: Next.js App Router with Server Components
**Rationale**: 
- Server-first architecture reduces JavaScript bundle size for admin-heavy interfaces
- Built-in API routes eliminate need for separate backend
- React Server Components ideal for data-heavy admin dashboards
- Native TypeScript support ensures type safety across full stack

**Alternatives Considered**: 
- Separate React SPA + Express API (rejected: adds complexity, no performance benefit)
- Pages Router (rejected: App Router provides better server component support)

### Decision: Drizzle ORM for Database Operations  
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe database operations with TypeScript integration
- Lightweight compared to Prisma for admin interfaces
- Excellent PostgreSQL support with multi-tenant query patterns
- Query builder approach aligns with constitutional database efficiency requirements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Raw SQL with pg (rejected: loses type safety, increases maintenance overhead)
- Prisma (rejected: larger bundle size, over-engineered for this use case)

### Decision: shadcn/ui + Tailwind for Component Library
**Rationale**:
- Consistent design system already established in montessori-app
- Highly customizable components suitable for admin interfaces
- Excellent TypeScript support and accessibility features
- Copy-paste architecture allows customization without vendor lock-in

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Material-UI (rejected: different design paradigm, bundle size concerns)
- Headless UI (rejected: requires more custom styling work)

## Architecture Patterns

### Decision: Page-Scoped Components Architecture
**Rationale**:
- Components scoped under `app/admin/applications/components/` prevent global namespace pollution
- Shared UI components live in global `components/ui/` following constitutional requirements
- Clear separation between feature-specific and reusable components
- Enables micro-function principles with focused component responsibilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monolithic component library (rejected: violates component reuse gate)
- Feature-based folder structure (rejected: doesn't align with Next.js conventions)

### Decision: Multi-Tenant Query Scoping Strategy
**Rationale**:
- All database queries automatically scoped by school/team ID at the ORM level
- Middleware-level tenant isolation prevents accidental cross-tenant data access
- Access logs table captures all admin actions with tenant context
- Supports constitutional multi-tenant security requirements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Application-level scoping (rejected: prone to human error)
- Database-level row security (rejected: added complexity for current scale)

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Decision: Server-Side Pagination with Search
**Rationale**:
- Handles large application datasets (10k+ per school) efficiently
- Search functionality implemented at database level for performance
- Reduces client-side JavaScript bundle and improves initial page loads
- Supports responsive admin workflows with fast filtering

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Client-side pagination (rejected: poor performance with large datasets)
- Infinite scroll (rejected: less suitable for admin review workflows)

### Decision: Optimistic Updates for Status Changes
**Rationale**:
- Immediate UI feedback for approve/reject actions improves admin productivity
- Background synchronization ensures data consistency
- Error handling with rollback maintains data integrity
- Aligns with performance goals of <200ms perceived response time

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Synchronous server updates (rejected: slower perceived performance)
- No optimistic updates (rejected: poor user experience for frequent admin actions)

## Security & Compliance Patterns

### Decision: Route-Level RBAC with Middleware Enforcement
**Rationale**:
- Admin-only routes protected at middleware level before page rendering
- Session validation includes role checking with automatic invalidation on role changes
- Audit logging captures all application processing actions
- Supports constitutional multi-tenant security gate requirements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Component-level security (rejected: can be bypassed, not comprehensive enough)
- Server action only protection (rejected: doesn't protect page access)

### Decision: Read-Only Application Data with Immutable Audit Trail
**Rationale**:
- Application data preserved exactly as submitted for legal/compliance requirements
- Admin actions (approve/reject) tracked separately from original application
- Data integrity maintained through database constraints and application logic
- Supports requirement for permanent rejection record retention

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Editable applications (rejected: violates data integrity requirements from clarifications)
- Soft delete for rejections (rejected: contradicts permanent retention requirement)

## Integration Patterns

### Decision: Email-Based Parent Profile Matching
**Rationale**:
- Email address serves as unique identifier for parent profile linking
- Automatic linking reduces data duplication and improves data quality
- Fallback to new profile creation handles edge cases gracefully
- Simple matching logic reduces implementation complexity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Full name + phone matching (rejected: prone to false positives/negatives)
- Manual admin selection (rejected: adds workflow complexity)
- No duplicate checking (rejected: violates data quality principles)

## State Management Strategy

### Decision: Server State with React Query (TanStack Query)
**Rationale**:
- Excellent caching for frequently accessed application data
- Built-in optimistic updates support for status changes  
- Background refetching ensures data freshness for admin workflows
- Minimal client-side state management complexity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux/Zustand (rejected: overkill for server-heavy admin interface)
- Native React state (rejected: insufficient for complex async state)
- SWR (rejected: React Query has better optimistic update patterns)

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Multi-Layer Testing with Focus on Integration
**Rationale**:
- Jest + React Testing Library for component testing with user interaction focus
- Playwright for end-to-end admin workflow testing
- Database integration tests for multi-tenant query scoping validation
- Contract tests for API route validation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Unit testing only (rejected: insufficient for complex admin workflows)  
- Manual testing only (rejected: doesn't scale, error-prone for RBAC validation)

## Development Workflow

### Decision: Feature-Branch Development with Constitutional Gates
**Rationale**:
- Each phase validates constitutional compliance before progression
- Specification-first development ensures requirements clarity
- Code review process enforces architectural principles
- Supports iterative development with quality gates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Trunk-based development (rejected: harder to enforce quality gates)
- Long-lived feature branches (rejected: integration complexity)
