**Feature Branch**: `014-build-the-attendance`  
**Created**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build the Attendance & Daily Logs feature in the Teacher Module of montessori-app. This feature allows Teachers to record daily attendance and student activity logs."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Teacher attendance tracking and daily logs
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Teachers, Students
   ‚Üí Actions: Mark attendance, record daily notes, review/edit entries
   ‚Üí Data: Attendance records, daily logs, student information
   ‚Üí Constraints: Teacher role access only, tenant-scoped data
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Backdated entry policy after day closes]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Multiple teacher attendance for same child policy]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Parent visibility into attendance/logs]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Historical edit permissions after day closes]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Teacher accesses class roster, marks attendance, adds notes
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 8 core requirements identified, all testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Attendance, Student, Teacher entities with relationships
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - 4 clarification items remain
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: How should the system handle attendance entries made after the school day has ended? ‚Üí A: Allow backdated entries indefinitely with teacher permissions
- Q: How should the system handle multiple teachers trying to mark attendance for the same student (co-teaching scenarios)? ‚Üí A: Require consensus - both teachers must agree on status
- Q: Should parents have access to view their child's attendance records and daily logs? ‚Üí A: No parent access - teacher and admin only
- Q: What format should be used for daily notes storage? ‚Üí A: Free-form text field - single notes box
- Q: How long should attendance records be retained in the system? ‚Üí A: Seven years for compliance requirements

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A Teacher logs into the montessori-app and navigates to the attendance page to see their assigned class roster for the current day. They mark each student as present or absent using simple controls, then add optional daily notes for individual students covering activities like meals, naps, and behavioral observations. The Teacher saves this information, which is stored for future reference and can be reviewed or edited if mistakes are discovered.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a Teacher is logged in and has students assigned to their class, **When** they navigate to `/teacher/attendance`, **Then** they see a list of all students in their class for the current day with attendance controls
2. **Given** a Teacher is viewing the attendance page, **When** they mark a student as present or absent, **Then** the status is visually updated and ready to be saved
3. **Given** a Teacher has marked attendance for students, **When** they add daily notes (meals, naps, behavior) for specific students, **Then** the notes are associated with that student for the current date
4. **Given** a Teacher has completed attendance and notes, **When** they save the information, **Then** all data is persisted and they receive confirmation of successful save
5. **Given** a Teacher has previously saved attendance data, **When** they return to the attendance page on the same day, **Then** they can view and edit their existing entries
6. **Given** a Teacher attempts to access attendance functionality, **When** they are not authenticated as a Teacher role, **Then** they are denied access and redirected appropriately

### Edge Cases
- Teachers can enter attendance for any historical date with proper permissions and audit trail maintained
- Co-teaching scenarios require consensus from all assigned teachers before attendance status is finalized for shared students
- What occurs if a student is transferred between classes mid-day?
- How does the system behave when no students are assigned to a Teacher's class?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide Teachers access to an attendance page at `/teacher/attendance` that displays their assigned class roster for the current day
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow Teachers to mark each student as either present or absent using intuitive controls
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable Teachers to add optional daily notes for individual students using a single free-form text field
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist all attendance records and daily notes to the database with proper teacher and student associations
- **FR-005**: System MUST restrict attendance functionality to users with Teacher role permissions only
- **FR-006**: System MUST scope all attendance data to the Teacher's assigned school/tenant to ensure data isolation
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow Teachers to review and edit attendance entries and notes for any historical date with proper teacher permissions
- **FR-008**: System MUST associate each attendance record with the specific date, student, and teacher for accurate historical tracking
- **FR-009**: System MUST support backdated attendance entries indefinitely while maintaining audit trail of entry timestamps
- **FR-010**: System MUST require consensus from all assigned teachers before finalizing attendance status for students in co-teaching scenarios
- **FR-011**: System MUST restrict attendance and daily log access to teachers and administrators only, with no parent visibility
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain all attendance records and daily notes for seven years to meet compliance requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: System MUST maintain audit trail of all attendance entry timestamps and modifications
- **NFR-002**: System MUST implement seven-year data retention policy with automated compliance tracking
- **NFR-003**: System MUST support consensus workflow for co-teaching scenarios without performance degradation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Attendance**: Core record linking a student to attendance status and date, including associated teacher and optional daily notes
- **Student**: Child enrolled in the school system with class assignments and teacher relationships  
- **Teacher**: Staff member with permissions to record attendance for their assigned students within their tenant scope
- **Daily Notes**: Free-form text field associated with attendance records for teacher observations and comments
