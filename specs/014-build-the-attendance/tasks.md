# Tasks: Attendance & Daily Logs for Teachers

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/014-build-the-attendance/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-attendance.md, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   â†’ Found: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui
   â†’ Extract: tech stack, libraries, Teacher module integration
2. Load design documents:
   â†’ data-model.md: Attendance entity with co-teaching consensus workflow
   â†’ contracts/api-attendance.md: 4 REST endpoints for CRUD operations
   â†’ quickstart.md: Manual QA scenarios (automated tests skipped per user request)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   â†’ Setup: Database schema, types, enums
   â†’ Core: API endpoints, services, business logic
   â†’ UI: Server components, client components, forms
   â†’ Integration: Navigation, middleware, routing
   â†’ Polish: Manual validation scenarios
4. Apply task rules:
   â†’ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   â†’ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   â†’ Constitutional compliance markers included
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Manual QA validation approach (no automated tests per user request)
```

- [ ] T031 Execute Scenario 3: Co-Teaching Consensus per quickstart.md
- [ ] T032 Execute Scenario 4: Empty State Handling per quickstart.md
- [ ] T033 Execute Scenario 5: Error Handling per quickstart.md
- [ ] T034 Performance validation: Large class sizes (30+ students)
- [ ] T035 Security validation: Multi-tenant isolation testing

## Constitutional Compliance Markers

### ðŸ”§ Micro Functions & Simplicity
- T002, T005, T006, T007, T021, T022, T024, T027: Small, focused functions
- Each service file contains single-responsibility functions
- Route handlers kept minimal with logic extracted to services

### ðŸ”’ Multi-Tenant Security & RBAC
- T001: Database schema includes tenant_id for multi-tenant scoping
- T013, T014: RBAC enforcement at API level
- T023: Access logging for compliance
- T026, T028: Middleware and query-level tenant scoping
- T035: Security validation testing

### ðŸŽ¨ Component Reusability & UI Consistency
- T015-T020: shadcn/ui components with consistent styling
- T016, T019: Server components by default
- T017, T018, T020: Client components only where interactivity needed
- T025: Integration with existing navigation patterns

## Task-Specific Implementation Notes

### Database Tasks (T001-T004)
- **T001**: Include indexes for (teacher_id, date) and (student_id, date)
- **T002**: Export const enum, not hardcoded strings
- **T003**: Include proper foreign key relationships and constraints
- **T004**: Type definitions for API contracts and component props

### API Tasks (T009-T014)
- **T009**: GET endpoint with date query parameter, returns roster + attendance
- **T010**: POST endpoint for creating new attendance records
- **T011**: PUT endpoint for updating status and notes
- **T012**: DELETE endpoint for corrections (optional per contract)
- **T013**: Leverage existing teacher RBAC middleware patterns
- **T014**: All queries must include tenant_id filter

### UI Tasks (T015-T020)
- **T015**: Server component for initial data fetching and SEO
- **T016**: Server component displaying student roster with attendance status
- **T017**: Client component for presence/absence toggles with optimistic updates
- **T018**: Client component modal/form for adding daily notes
- **T019**: Server component for when no students assigned
- **T020**: Client component for date selection with URL state management

### Manual QA Tasks (T029-T036)
- Follow quickstart.md scenarios exactly as specified
- Document results and any issues found
- Validate constitutional compliance during testing
- No automated test creation (per user request)

## Validation Checklist
- [x] All contracts have corresponding implementation tasks
- [x] Attendance entity has complete model implementation
- [x] Manual QA scenarios replace automated tests (per user request)
- [x] Parallel tasks are truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] Constitutional compliance markers included
- [x] Dependencies clearly defined
- [x] Integration with existing Teacher module planned

## Notes
- Manual QA validation approach used instead of automated tests per user specification
- Tasks ordered by dependencies: database â†’ services â†’ API â†’ UI â†’ integration â†’ validation
- All [P] marked tasks can run simultaneously (different files, no shared dependencies) 
- Constitutional compliance built into task design from the start
- Integration tasks ensure seamless fit with existing montessori-app architecture
