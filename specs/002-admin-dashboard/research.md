# Research: Admin Dashboard Implementation

## Server-Side Rendering Strategy

**Decision**: Use Next.js App Router server components for dashboard with minimal client-side interactivity
**Rationale**: 
- Meets <500ms TTFB performance requirement through server-side rendering
- Reduces JavaScript bundle size for faster initial page loads
- Enables SEO and accessibility benefits for admin interfaces
- Aligns with Monte SMS Constitution client-server boundaries principle
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Client-side rendering with React Query - higher bundle size, slower initial render
- Server-side generation (SSG) - not suitable for real-time metrics that change frequently

## Consolidated API Approach

**Decision**: Single `/api/admin/metrics` endpoint returning all dashboard data in one request
**Rationale**:
- Minimizes database connections and round trips
- Enables consistent data snapshot across all metrics
- Simplifies caching and error handling
- Reduces complexity in component data fetching
**Alternatives considered**:
- Individual endpoints per metric - more database overhead, consistency issues
- GraphQL endpoint - unnecessary complexity for single dashboard use case

## Chart Library Selection

**Decision**: Recharts for interactive dashboard charts with `use client` directive
**Rationale**:
- Lightweight React-native charting with good performance
- TypeScript support and good documentation
- Integrates well with shadcn/ui design system
- Can be isolated to client components without affecting server rendering
**Alternatives considered**:
- Chart.js - requires more manual integration work
- D3.js - overly complex for dashboard metric charts
- Server-side chart generation - reduces interactivity, more complex implementation

## Component Architecture Pattern

**Decision**: Scoped component folder at `app/admin/dashboard/components/` with micro-components
**Rationale**:
- Follows Monte SMS Constitution component organization principle
- Enables parallel development and testing of individual components
- Keeps dashboard logic isolated from shared UI components
- Facilitates micro function approach with single-responsibility components
**Alternatives considered**:
- Global components folder - violates scoped component principle
- Inline components in page file - creates large files, violates micro function principle

## Database Query Optimization

**Decision**: Batch all metrics queries in single transaction with tenant scoping
**Rationale**:
- Ensures data consistency across all displayed metrics
- Minimizes database connection overhead
- Enforces multi-tenant security at query level
- Enables better performance monitoring and optimization
**Alternatives considered**:
- Individual queries per component - consistency and performance issues
- Client-side data fetching - violates server-first principle, security concerns

## Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Server-side caching with Next.js unstable_cache for metric data
**Rationale**:
- Reduces database load for frequently accessed dashboard
- Maintains data freshness with appropriate TTL settings
- Enables consistent performance under load
- Can be invalidated on data updates
**Alternatives considered**:
- No caching - poor performance under load
- Client-side caching - violates server-first architecture
- External cache (Redis) - unnecessary complexity for current scale

## Empty State Handling

**Decision**: Server-rendered empty states with actionable guidance
**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate feedback without additional client requests
- Maintains consistent design language with existing app
- Enables better user experience for new schools
- Supports accessibility requirements
**Alternatives considered**:
- Client-side empty state detection - slower rendering, more complex logic
- Generic empty messages - poor user experience, no actionable guidance

## Security Alert Classification

**Decision**: Real-time security alerts with enum-based severity levels
**Rationale**:
- Enables immediate admin response to security incidents
- Provides clear priority classification for different alert types
- Follows constitution no-hardcoding principle with enums
- Supports audit requirements for security monitoring
**Alternatives considered**:
- Batch security reporting - delayed response to critical issues
- Manual security review - not scalable, human error prone
