# Feature Specification: Admin Dashboard for Monte SMS

**Feature Branch**: `002-admin-dashboard`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement the Admin Dashboard for montessori-app with metrics, alerts, and trends for school administrators."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Completed: Admin Dashboard requirements clearly specified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Admin users, Super Admin users
   → Actions: View metrics, monitor alerts, analyze trends
   → Data: School metrics, enrollment data, security alerts
   → Constraints: Server-side rendering, performance targets, constitutional compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects defined through user requirements and clarifications
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Admin dashboard viewing, empty state handling, cross-tenant access
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Metrics, alerts, trends, tenant-scoped data
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clear, business-focused specification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: Should Super Admins see aggregated metrics across multiple schools? → A: Yes, Super Admins see cross-school aggregates
- Q: What specific metrics should be displayed on the dashboard? → A: Pending applications, active enrollments, teacher activity, subscription status, security alerts
- Q: What constitutes a security alert that should be displayed? → A: Failed login attempts (>3 in 10 mins), suspicious IP patterns, expired sessions
- Q: How should empty states be handled when no data exists? → A: Show friendly empty state with guidance for next steps
- Q: What performance target should the dashboard meet? → A: Server-side render under 500ms TTFB

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Monte SMS Admin, I need a comprehensive dashboard so that I can quickly assess my school's operational status, monitor key metrics, and respond to urgent alerts without navigating multiple pages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an Admin user who has signed in, **When** I navigate to `/admin/dashboard`, **Then** I should see my school's key metrics (applications, enrollments, teacher activity, subscription status) rendered server-side within 500ms
2. **Given** I am a Super Admin user, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I should see aggregated metrics across all schools in my system
3. **Given** there are security alerts for my school, **When** I load the dashboard, **Then** I should see prominent alerts for failed logins, suspicious activities, or system issues
4. **Given** my school has no historical data, **When** I view trends sections, **Then** I should see helpful empty states with guidance on getting started
5. **Given** I want to investigate specific metrics, **When** I click on metric cards, **Then** I should be directed to detailed pages for deeper analysis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when metrics API fails to load? Dashboard should show cached data with refresh option.
- How are metrics handled for newly created schools with no data? Empty states with onboarding guidance.
- What if Admin loses permissions while viewing dashboard? Graceful redirect to unauthorized page.
- How are Super Admin cross-school metrics scoped for privacy? Only aggregate numbers, no individual school identification without consent.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display school-specific metrics (pending applications, active enrollments, teacher activity, subscription status) for Admin users
- **FR-002**: System MUST display aggregated cross-school metrics for Super Admin users without exposing individual school identifiable data
- **FR-003**: System MUST show security alerts (failed logins >3 in 10 mins, suspicious IP patterns, expired sessions) in prominent dashboard banner
- **FR-004**: System MUST render dashboard server-side with TTFB under 500ms using consolidated API endpoint
- **FR-005**: System MUST display helpful empty states with actionable guidance when no data exists for any metric category
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clickable metric cards that link to detailed analysis pages
- **FR-007**: System MUST use tenant-scoped database queries to ensure data isolation between schools
- **FR-008**: System MUST batch all metric queries into single API call to minimize database load
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve existing montessori-app visual design (Tailwind classes, shadcn/ui components, color schemes, typography) while adding dashboard-specific components that follow the established design system
- **FR-010**: System MUST define all metric types, roles, and alert categories as enumerated constants without hardcoded strings

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Dashboard MUST render server-side with Time to First Byte (TTFB) under 500ms
- **NFR-002**: Metrics API MUST execute all queries in single database transaction for consistency
- **NFR-003**: Component architecture MUST minimize client-side JavaScript bundle size
- **NFR-004**: Security alerts MUST update in real-time or near real-time (within 5 minutes)
- **NFR-005**: Dashboard MUST be responsive and accessible across desktop and tablet devices

### Key Entities
- **School Metrics**: Aggregated counts and status indicators for school operations (applications, enrollments, teachers, subscriptions)
- **Security Alert**: Time-sensitive notifications about authentication failures, suspicious activities, or system issues
- **Trend Data**: Historical patterns for enrollment, application volume, and teacher engagement over time
- **Dashboard Context**: User-specific view permissions and cross-tenant access controls
