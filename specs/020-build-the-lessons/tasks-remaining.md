# Tasks: Lessons Management - Remaining Features

## Overview
Based on Playwright MCP testing completed on 2025-10-05, the following tasks remain to complete the Lessons Management feature per the specification requirements.

## Test Results Summary

## Dependency Notes
- Setup and bug fixes (T019) completed
- Teacher pages (T020-T023) can be developed in parallel after T020 foundation
- Admin detail/edit pages (T024-T025) independent of teacher pages
- Delete functionality (T026-T027) depends on respective list pages
- Navigation updates (T028-T029) depend on respective page sets
- Advanced features (T030-T031) optional and can be parallel
- Testing (T032-T034) requires all implementation complete

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Example 1: After completing T020 (teacher lessons list)
```bash
# Run these tasks in parallel:
- T021 (teacher new lesson page)
- T022 (teacher lesson detail page)
- T024 (admin lesson detail page)
- T026 (admin delete confirmation)
- T028 (admin navigation update)
```

### Example 2: After completing T020-T023 (all teacher pages)
```bash
# Run these tasks in parallel:
- T027 (teacher delete confirmation)
- T029 (teacher navigation update)
- T030 (lesson cloning)
```

### Example 3: Final testing phase
```bash
# Run these tasks in parallel:
- T032 (admin CRUD testing)
- T033 (teacher RBAC testing)
- T034 (multi-tenant testing)
```

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Core Features)
1. T020-T023: Teacher lessons pages (missing from spec)
2. T024-T025: Admin detail/edit pages (complete CRUD)
3. T026-T027: Delete functionality (complete CRUD)
4. T028-T029: Navigation updates (discoverability)

### Medium Priority (Enhancements)
5. T030: Lesson cloning (spec requirement)

### Low Priority (Future)
6. T031: Usage indicators (nice-to-have)

### Always Required
7. T032-T034: Testing (validation)

## Success Criteria
- All CRUD operations work for both Admin and Teacher
- RBAC properly enforced (teachers can't edit admin lessons)
- Multi-tenant isolation verified
- Search and filtering functional
- Navigation intuitive and complete
- All edge cases from spec handled (cloning, deletion, etc.)
