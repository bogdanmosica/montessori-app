# Lessons Management Feature - Implementation Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented the Lessons Management feature for the Montessori School Management System with full RBAC, multi-tenant scoping, and audit logging.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Setup Phase (T001-T003)
- Audited existing lessons module and components
- Added lesson category and visibility enums/constants
- Verified Drizzle ORM and Auth.js configuration

### ✅ Models & Data Phase (T004-T005)
- Extended Lesson model in Drizzle ORM with visibility field
- Added `lessonVisibilityEnum` to schema
- Generated and ran database migration
- User and School models verified (no changes needed)

### ✅ API Endpoints Phase (T006-T010)
- **GET /api/lessons** - List lessons with role-based filtering, category/search support
- **POST /api/lessons** - Create lesson (Admin/Teacher, with role-based visibility rules)
- **GET /api/lessons/[id]** - Get lesson details
- **PUT /api/lessons/[id]** - Update lesson (RBAC enforced)
- **DELETE /api/lessons/[id]** - Delete lesson (RBAC enforced)
- **POST /api/lessons/[id]/clone** - Clone global lesson to private copy

### ✅ UI Components Phase (T011-T013)
- Created `LessonsTable.tsx` - List view with badges for visibility/difficulty
- Created `LessonForm.tsx` - Form for add/edit with Zod validation
- Created `LessonsFilter.tsx` - Search and category filtering
- Created admin lessons page with search params support
- Created new lesson page with client-side form handling

### ✅ Integration & Security Phase (T014-T015)
- Enforced RBAC in all endpoints (Admin vs Teacher permissions)
- Multi-tenant scoping via schoolId in all queries
- Teachers can only edit/delete own lessons
- Teachers cannot create global lessons
- Created `lesson-logger.ts` utility for audit logging
- All lesson actions logged to `extended_access_logs`

### ✅ Polish Phase (T016-T018)
- Reviewed for micro function compliance ✓
- Reviewed for no hardcoded strings ✓
- Reviewed UI for shadcn/ui and Tailwind consistency ✓

## Files Created

### Constants & Validation
- `lib/constants/lessons.ts` - Lesson categories, visibility, difficulty, validation rules
- `lib/validations/lesson-schemas.ts` - Zod schemas for create/update/query

### Services & Utilities
- `lib/services/lesson-service.ts` - Database operations with RBAC
- `lib/utils/lesson-logger.ts` - Audit logging utility

### API Routes
- `app/api/lessons/route.ts` - GET and POST endpoints
- `app/api/lessons/[id]/route.ts` - GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints
- `app/api/lessons/[id]/clone/route.ts` - Clone endpoint

### UI Components
- `app/admin/lessons/components/lessons-table.tsx`
- `app/admin/lessons/components/lesson-form.tsx`
- `app/admin/lessons/components/lessons-filter.tsx`
- `app/admin/lessons/page.tsx`
- `app/admin/lessons/new/page.tsx`

### Database
- Updated `lib/db/schema/lessons.ts` with visibility field
- Migration: `lib/db/migrations/0002_gigantic_gertrude_yorkes.sql`

### Updated Files
- `lib/constants/access-log-actions.ts` - Added lesson actions and LESSON target type

## Key Features Implemented

### Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Can create global/private lessons, edit/delete any lesson
- **Teacher**: Can create private lessons only, edit/delete own lessons, clone global lessons
- **Visibility Rules**:
  - Global lessons visible to all teachers in school
  - Private lessons visible only to creator

### Multi-Tenant Security
- All queries scoped by schoolId (teamId)
- No cross-school data access
- Session validation on all endpoints

### Audit Logging
- LESSON_CREATED
- LESSON_UPDATED
- LESSON_DELETED
- LESSON_CLONED
- LESSON_VIEWED

### Data Validation
- Title: max 100 chars
- Description: max 2000 chars
- Duration: 5-300 minutes
- Category: validated against enum
- Visibility: validated against enum

## Constitutional Compliance

✅ **Micro Functions**: All functions are focused and single-purpose
✅ **Client Directive**: 'use client' only on interactive components
✅ **Component Reuse**: Leveraged existing shadcn/ui components
✅ **Multi-Tenant Security**: All queries scoped by school/team
✅ **Database Efficiency**: Proper indexes and query optimization
✅ **No Hardcoding**: All values in constants/enums
✅ **Specification-First**: Followed data-model.md and contracts exactly

## Testing Notes
- No dedicated testing phase per user instruction
- Manual review and proven module patterns relied upon
- RBAC and multi-tenant security enforced at service layer
- All endpoints follow existing auth patterns

## Next Steps
1. Update admin navigation to include Lessons link
2. Create similar teacher lessons pages (reuse components)
3. Add lesson detail/view pages
4. Add edit lesson functionality
5. Test end-to-end with real data

## Architecture Alignment
- Follows Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Uses async/await for searchParams
- Server components for data fetching
- Client components for interactivity
- Consistent error handling
- Proper TypeScript types throughout
