# Research: Lessons Management Feature

## Decision: Reuse Existing Module & Components
- The feature will leverage existing lessons management modules and UI components wherever possible.
- No new testing phase will be added at this stage (per user instruction).

## Rationale
- Reduces duplication and leverages proven, stable code.
- Ensures UI/UX consistency and speeds up delivery.
- Avoids unnecessary test scaffolding for initial rollout.

## Alternatives Considered
- Building new modules from scratch: Rejected due to increased maintenance and slower delivery.
- Adding a dedicated testing phase: Deferred, as per user request to skip for now.

## Best Practices
- Audit existing components in `components/`, `app/[role]/lessons/components/`, and shared `ui/` before creating new files.
- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations.
- Enforce RBAC and multi-tenant scoping in all queries and API endpoints.
- Use enums/consts for lesson categories and visibility.
- Apply micro function and small file principles throughout.

## Integration Patterns
- API endpoints should be shared and role-filtered (`/api/lessons`).
- UI should use server components for data fetching, client components only for forms/interactions.
- All lesson actions must be logged for audit compliance.

## Unknowns
- None. All critical clarifications resolved in spec.
