# Feature Specification: Admin Reports Page

**Feature Branch**: `008-admin-reports-page`  
**Created**: September 29, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "admin/reports page. Build the /admin/reports feature for montessori-app. This page allows Admins to generate and view reports across key areas (applications, enrollments, payments, and school activity)."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature parsed: Admin reporting system for montessori applications
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Admins
   ‚Üí Actions: generate, view, filter, export reports
   ‚Üí Data: applications, enrollments, payments, school activity
   ‚Üí Constraints: tenant-scoped, role-based access
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for report generation and export
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and measurable
   ‚Üí Ambiguous requirements marked for clarification
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
   ‚Üí Reports, filters, export formats identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - spec has uncertainties
8. Return: WARN "Spec has uncertainties that need clarification"
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: For large reports (e.g., 1000+ records), how should report generation be handled to maintain good user experience? ‚Üí A: Generate synchronously - user waits, report appears immediately
- Q: What level of personally identifiable information should be included in exported reports? ‚Üí A: Full PII - include parent emails, phone numbers, addresses
- Q: How should the system handle report storage and access? ‚Üí A: Generate on-demand - create fresh report each time requested
- Q: Should PDF export functionality be included in the initial implementation? ‚Üí A: Yes, required - include both CSV and PDF export options
- Q: Should the system support scheduled/recurring report generation? ‚Üí A: No, manual only - Admins generate reports when needed

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a school Administrator, I need to generate comprehensive reports about my school's operations (applications, enrollments, payments, and activities) so I can maintain records for compliance, analyze trends, and make data-driven decisions. I need to filter these reports by date ranges and status, and export them for offline use and record-keeping.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an authenticated Admin user, **When** I navigate to /admin/reports, **Then** I should see a reports dashboard with options to generate different report types
2. **Given** I am on the reports page, **When** I select "Applications Report" and choose a date range, **Then** I should see a filtered list of applications with their status and details
3. **Given** I have generated a report, **When** I click "Export CSV", **Then** I should receive a downloadable CSV file with all report data
4. **Given** I am viewing an enrollments report, **When** I filter by "Active" status, **Then** I should only see enrolled children with active status
5. **Given** I am a non-Admin user, **When** I try to access /admin/reports, **Then** I should be redirected to unauthorized page
6. **Given** I select a payments report, **When** I apply date filters, **Then** I should see payments, failed charges, and refunds within that timeframe

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a report contains no data for the selected filters?
- How does the system handle very large reports with thousands of records?
- What happens when export generation fails?
- How are reports scoped when an Admin manages multiple schools/tenants?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST restrict access to /admin/reports to users with Admin role only
- **FR-002**: System MUST scope all reports to the Admin's current tenant/school context
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide report generation for applications, enrollments, payments, and school activity
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow filtering reports by date range (start date and end date)
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow filtering reports by status using predefined enum values
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide CSV export functionality for all generated reports
- **FR-007**: System MUST display report data in tabular format with appropriate columns for each report type
- **FR-008**: System MUST show summarized metrics alongside detailed report data
- **FR-009**: System MUST use predefined constants/enums for all status values and report types
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle empty result sets gracefully with appropriate messaging
- **FR-011**: Applications reports MUST include application date, parent information, child information, status, and submission details
- **FR-012**: Enrollments reports MUST include enrolled children, linked parent information, enrollment dates, and status
- **FR-013**: Payments reports MUST include successful payments, failed charges, refunds, amounts, and transaction dates
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide both CSV and PDF export functionality for all generated reports
- **FR-015**: System MUST process report generation synchronously with loading indicators for user feedback during data processing
- **FR-016**: System MUST include full personally identifiable information in reports including parent names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses
- **FR-017**: System MUST generate reports on-demand without persisting generated report data in the database
- **FR-018**: System MUST NOT include scheduled or recurring report generation - all reports are generated manually on-demand by Admins

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Report**: Represents a generated data export with type (applications/enrollments/payments/activity), filters applied, generation timestamp, and format
- **Report Filter**: Represents filtering criteria including date range (start/end dates), status values, and entity types
- **Export Format**: Represents available export formats (CSV and PDF both required per FR-014) with associated generation methods
- **Report Data**: Represents the actual data rows returned by each report type, structured according to the specific report requirements
