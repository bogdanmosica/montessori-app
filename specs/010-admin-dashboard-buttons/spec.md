# Feature Specification: Admin Dashboard Controls & Settings

**Feature Branch**: `010-admin-dashboard-buttons`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "/admin/dashboard - buttons. Extend the `/admin/dashboard` feature in montessori-app with a Refresh buttonand a new Settings page."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature extends existing admin dashboard with refresh and settings controls
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Admin users
   ‚Üí Actions: Refresh dashboard data, configure school settings
   ‚Üí Data: Dashboard metrics, school default settings (fees, enrollments)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Admin-only access, multi-tenant scoping
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows for refresh and settings management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (school settings data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec has some uncertainties marked for clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: When an Admin hasn't set a default monthly fee, what should happen during child enrollment creation? ‚Üí A: Use system-wide default fee (if configured)
- Q: How should the free empty enrollments limit be applied? ‚Üí A: School-wide total (shared across all classrooms)
- Q: When multiple Admins from the same school edit settings simultaneously, how should conflicts be resolved? ‚Üí A: Last-write-wins (overwrite without warning)
- Q: Should settings changes be recorded in audit logs for compliance and tracking purposes? ‚Üí A: No, settings changes don't require audit trails

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a school Administrator, I need to refresh dashboard data without full page reloads and configure default settings for my school to streamline child enrollment and fee management processes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as an Admin viewing `/admin/dashboard`, **When** I click the Refresh button, **Then** all dashboard metrics and alerts update with current data without page reload
2. **Given** I am logged in as an Admin on the dashboard, **When** I click the Settings button, **Then** I navigate to `/admin/dashboard/settings`
3. **Given** I am on the Settings page, **When** I set a default monthly fee and save, **Then** this fee appears as the default when creating new child enrollments
4. **Given** I am on the Settings page, **When** I set the number of free empty enrollments and save, **Then** this limit is enforced in enrollment creation flows
5. **Given** I am viewing the Settings page, **When** another Admin from my school has previously saved settings, **Then** I see the current values pre-populated in the form

### Edge Cases
- What happens when refresh fails due to network issues?
- What happens if an Admin tries to set a negative fee amount?
- How does the system handle concurrent settings updates from multiple Admins?
- What occurs if an Admin hasn't set default values and tries to create enrollments?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a Refresh button on the admin dashboard that reloads metrics without full page refresh
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a Settings button on the admin dashboard that navigates to settings page
- **FR-003**: System MUST restrict Refresh and Settings functionality to users with Admin role only
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a Settings page at `/admin/dashboard/settings` accessible only to Admins
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow Admins to set and save a default monthly fee per child in RON currency
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow Admins to set and save the number of free empty enrollments available
- **FR-007**: System MUST scope all settings to the Admin's school/team (multi-tenant isolation)
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist settings in the database for retrieval across sessions
- **FR-009**: System MUST apply saved default fee when creating new child enrollments
- **FR-010**: System MUST apply saved empty enrollment limit in enrollment creation flows
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate that monthly fee values are non-negative numbers
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that empty enrollment count is a non-negative integer
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle refresh failures gracefully with user feedback
- **FR-014**: System MUST use system-wide default fee when school Admin hasn't set school-specific default fee, falling back to 0 RON if no system default exists (system-wide default managed via application configuration)
- **FR-015**: System MUST enforce free empty enrollments as a school-wide total shared across all classrooms, not per-classroom quotas
- **FR-016**: System MUST use last-write-wins strategy for concurrent settings updates, where the most recent save overwrites previous changes without conflict warnings


### Key Entities *(data involved)*
- **School Settings**: Represents configurable defaults for a school including default monthly fee (RON), number of free empty enrollments, associated school ID for multi-tenant scoping
- **Admin Dashboard Metrics**: Represents the data displayed on dashboard that can be refreshed including student counts, enrollment statistics, financial summaries, system alerts
