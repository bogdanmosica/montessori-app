## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a School Administrator, I need to manage student enrollments so that I can track which children are currently enrolled, maintain accurate enrollment records, and ensure each enrollment is properly linked to complete child profile information for educational planning and compliance purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as an Admin, **When** I navigate to /admin/enrollments, **Then** I see a list of all current enrollments with child details including name, enrollment status, and enrollment dates
2. **Given** I am viewing the enrollments list, **When** I click "Add New Enrollment", **Then** I can either create a new child record or link to an existing child record to create the enrollment
3. **Given** I am viewing an enrollment record, **When** I click "Edit", **Then** I can update enrollment details (status, dates) and associated child information in a single interface
4. **Given** I am viewing an enrollment record, **When** I click "Remove Enrollment", **Then** the enrollment status is changed to "withdrawn" while the child record remains in the system
5. **Given** I am viewing the enrollments list, **When** I use the status filter, **Then** I see only enrollments matching the selected status (active, inactive, archived)
6. **Given** I am viewing the enrollments list, **When** I use the search function, **Then** I can find enrollments by child name or parent name

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an admin attempts to enroll a child who already has an active enrollment? System blocks the action and displays an error message.
- How does the system handle enrollments when a child record is deleted from the children table? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this prevent deletion, cascade delete, or orphan the enrollment?]
- Can a single child be enrolled in multiple programs or schools simultaneously? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Business rule needed]
- When removing an enrollment, related educational records (observations, assessments) are automatically archived.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST restrict access to /admin/enrollments to users with Admin role only
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of all enrollments with child name, enrollment status, enrollment date, and parent information
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow Admins to create new enrollments by either creating a new child record or linking to an existing child
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow Admins to edit enrollment details including status, dates, and associated child information
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow Admins to remove enrollments by changing status to "withdrawn"
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain referential integrity between enrollments and children table records
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide filtering capability for enrollment status (active, inactive, archived)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide search functionality for finding enrollments by child name or parent name
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent enrollment creation and display error message when attempting to enroll a child with an existing active enrollment
- **FR-010**: System MUST use predefined enums/constants for enrollment statuses and roles (no hardcoded strings)
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure each enrollment record is associated with exactly one child record
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that child profile information is complete before allowing enrollment creation
- **FR-013**: System operates within single school context - all enrollments are for the same school
- **FR-014**: System MUST automatically archive related educational records (observations, assessments) when an enrollment is withdrawn
- **FR-015**: System MUST prevent deletion of child records that have associated enrollments and display appropriate error message

### Key Entities
- **Enrollment**: Represents a student's enrollment in the school/program, including enrollment date, status, and link to child record
- **Child**: Student profile containing personal information, parent details, and other educational records
- **Enrollment Status**: Enumerated values representing current state of enrollment (active, inactive, archived, etc.)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: When an admin removes an enrollment, how should the system handle it? ‚Üí A: Status change - change status to "withdrawn"
- Q: What should happen when attempting to enroll a child who already has an active enrollment? ‚Üí A: Block with error message
- Q: Can a single child be enrolled in multiple schools or programs simultaneously? ‚Üí A: the app is only for one school
- Q: When an enrollment is removed (status changed to "withdrawn"), what should happen to related educational records? ‚Üí A: Archive automatically
- Q: What should happen if someone attempts to delete a child record that has associated enrollments? ‚Üí A: Prevent deletion with error message

These clarifications will determine specific business rules and validation logic for the enrollment management system.
