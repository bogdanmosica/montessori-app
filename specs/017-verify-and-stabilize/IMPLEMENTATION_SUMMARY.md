## Key Findings

### ✅ Verified Items
1. **Database Migration Complete**:
   - `schools` table exists with all required fields
   - `school_members` table replaces `team_members`
   - All foreign key relationships updated
   - Migration includes all schema extensions (teachers, observations, attendance, etc.)

2. **Test Accounts Configured**:
   - Seed script uses correct table names (`schools`, `schoolMembers`)
   - All three roles (Admin, Teacher, Parent) have test accounts
   - Sample data includes families, children, applications, and payments

3. **Routes Verified**:
   - Admin routes: All major pages exist
   - Teacher routes: All major pages exist
   - Parent routes: Limited implementation (known gap)

### ⚠️ Known Issues/Limitations

1. **Parent Dashboard Not Fully Implemented**:
   - No dedicated `/app/parent/` directory found
   - Parent routes may redirect or show limited functionality
   - This is a known limitation to be addressed in future sprints

2. **Legacy Reference in Schema**:
   - `extended_access_logs` table still has `team_id` field
   - However, it correctly references `schools.id` via foreign key
   - Not a functional issue, but could be renamed for consistency

3. **Manual Testing Required**:
   - No automated tests created (per specification requirements)
   - All test cases must be executed manually by QA team
   - Results must be documented using provided templates

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Execute Manual Tests**:
   - QA team should use `MANUAL_TEST_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md`
   - Test all 16 scenarios (T004-T016)
   - Document results in the guide's result sections

2. **Log Issues Found**:
   - Use T018 framework to report issues
   - Categorize by priority (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Include screenshots and reproduction steps

3. **Verify Constitutional Compliance**:
   - Run SQL queries provided in guide to verify audit logging (T014)
   - Test RBAC enforcement across all roles (T015)
   - Confirm tenant isolation with multi-school setup (T016)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Implement Parent Dashboard**:
   - Create `/app/parent/dashboard` route
   - Add parent-specific metrics and child list
   - Implement payment history viewing

2. **Clean Up Legacy References**:
   - Consider renaming `extended_access_logs.team_id` to `school_id`
   - Search for any remaining `team` references in comments or docs

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Consider adding Playwright E2E tests in future sprint
   - Automate constitutional compliance checks
   - Add performance monitoring for 2-second load time requirement

## Constitutional Compliance Verification

### Audit Logging (Principle 4)
- ✅ `access_logs` table exists
- ✅ All major actions should be logged
- ⏳ **Manual verification required**: Run tests to confirm logging works

### RBAC Enforcement (Principle 5)
- ✅ Middleware enforces role-based access
- ✅ Unauthorized route redirects configured
- ⏳ **Manual verification required**: Test cross-role access attempts

### Multi-Tenant Security (Principle 6)
- ✅ All tables include `schoolId` or equivalent
- ✅ Queries should filter by `schoolId`
- ⏳ **Manual verification required**: Confirm no cross-tenant data leakage

---

### Seed Data
- Seed script: `lib/db/seed.ts`
- Creates 1 test school
- Creates 3 test users (Admin, Teacher, Parent)
- Seeds 3 families with 6 children

## Summary

This implementation successfully prepared the Montessori-App for manual verification after database migration. All setup tasks are complete, test accounts are ready, and a comprehensive manual testing guide has been created.

**No code changes were made** (as per specification requirements). This phase focused entirely on preparation and documentation for manual user testing.

The next critical step is for the QA team to execute the manual tests using the provided guide and report any issues found through the T18 framework.
