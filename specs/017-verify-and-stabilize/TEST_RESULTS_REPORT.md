---

#### T005: Admin Applications List ✅ PASSED
**Status**: PASSED
**URL**: `/admin/applications`

- ✅ RBAC enforcement active

---

### ✅ Teacher Role Test Cases

#### T008: Teacher Dashboard ✅ PASSED (with initial issue)
**Status**: PASSED
**URL**: `/teacher/dashboard`

**Initial Issue**: Teacher user initially redirected to `/unauthorized` due to missing teacher record in `teachers` table.

**Resolution**: Executed `scripts/seed-teacher-data.ts` to create teacher record.

**Test Results After Fix**:
- ✅ Dashboard loaded without errors
- ✅ Teacher navigation visible: Dashboard, My Students, Attendance, Progress Board
- ✅ Metrics displaying correctly:
  - Total Students: 0
  - Active Students: 0
  - Inactive Students: 0
- ✅ Empty state message: "No Students Assigned"
- ✅ Helpful instruction: "Contact your administrator to get students assigned"

**Screenshot**: `.playwright-mcp/teacher-dashboard-test.png`

**Issue Found**: Teacher record was not created by main seed script (`lib/db/seed.ts`). Needed to run separate teacher seed script.

**Recommendation**: Update main seed script to automatically create teacher records for teacher users.

  - Payment records: `school_id=1`
  - Applications: scoped by school
- ✅ Metrics show only school-specific data
- ✅ No cross-tenant data visible in any view
- ✅ API responses properly scoped

**Evidence from Server Logs**:
```

📊 Cashflow calculation details: {
  totalChildren: 0,
  activeEnrollments: [],
  ...
}
GET /api/admin/payments/dashboard-v2?school_id=1 200
GET /api/admin/payments/alerts?school_id=1&is_resolved=false 200
```

**Verification Method**: Server logs show all database queries include schoolId parameter

## Issues Found and Recommendations

### 🟡 Issue #1: Teacher Record Initialization (MEDIUM)
**Description**: Teacher user exists in `users` table but corresponding record in `teachers` table was not created by main seed script.

**Impact**: Teacher users cannot access teacher dashboard until teacher record is manually created.

**Root Cause**: Main seed script (`lib/db/seed.ts`) creates users and school_members but does not create records in `teachers` table.

**Resolution Applied**: Manually executed `scripts/seed-teacher-data.ts` to create teacher record.

**Recommendation**:
- Update `lib/db/seed.ts` to automatically create teacher records for users with teacher role
- Or ensure teacher onboarding process creates teacher record automatically

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: Workaround Applied

---

### 🟢 Issue #2: Data Inconsistency - Enrollments vs Children (LOW)
**Description**: Applications page shows 6 children but metrics show 0 Active Enrollments.

**Impact**: Metrics may be confusing to users.

**Root Cause**: Seed data creates children directly but doesn't create corresponding enrollment records.

**Recommendation**:
- Ensure seed script creates enrollment records for all children
- Or update metrics to count children instead of enrollment records
- Clarify relationship between children and enrollments

**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Noted for future improvement

## Database Migration Verification

### Schema Changes Verified ✅
- ✅ `schools` table exists with correct structure
- ✅ `school_members` table exists with correct structure
- ✅ All foreign key relationships updated to use `schools.id`
- ✅ Migration file `0000_thankful_garia.sql` contains correct definitions
