# Feature Specification: Admin Applications Management for Monte SMS

**Feature Branch**: `003-admin-applications`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User requirement: "Implement `/admin/applications` page for montessori-app with table listing, approval workflow, and parent/child record creation."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Completed: Admin Applications page requirements clearly specified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Admin users, Parents (applicants), Children (subjects of applications)
   → Actions: View applications, approve applications, reject applications, create parent accounts, create child records
   → Data: Application records, parent information, child information, enrollment records
   → Constraints: Admin-only access, database integrity, performance requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → All aspects defined through user requirements and technical specifications
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Application review workflows, approval processes, rejection handling
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → All requirements are testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → Applications, Parents, Children, Enrollments, User accounts
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clear, business-focused specification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: What information should be displayed in the applications table? → A: Parent name, child name, application date, program requested, current status, contact information
- Q: What happens when an application is approved? → A: System creates parent user account, child record, and enrollment entry linking them
- Q: What happens when an application is rejected? → A: Status updated to rejected, no parent/child records created, optional rejection reason stored
- Q: Should there be bulk operations for multiple applications? → A: No, individual approval/rejection to ensure careful review
- Q: What validation is needed for parent account creation? → A: Unique email, account setup with user-defined password, role assignment as Parent
- Q: Should approved applications be removable from the list? → A: No, maintain audit trail with status filtering options
- Q: For the applications management system, what is the expected concurrent usage pattern during peak enrollment periods? → A: Low concurrency: 1-3 admins processing applications simultaneously per school
- Q: What should happen when an admin tries to approve an application that another admin is currently processing? → A: Block with message: "Application being processed by [Admin Name]"
- Q: What level of audit detail should be captured for application processing actions? → A: Basic: Admin ID, application ID, action (approve/reject), timestamp
- Q: When generating temporary passwords for new parent accounts, what approach should be used? → A: They will add their own password on signup
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable page load time for the applications table under typical usage conditions? → A: Under 2 seconds: Acceptable for administrative interfaces

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Monte SMS Admin, I need to review and process school applications so that I can approve qualified families for enrollment and create their accounts in the system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am an Admin user, **When** I navigate to `/admin/applications`, **Then** I should see a paginated table of all applications with filtering by status (pending/approved/rejected)
2. **Given** I see a pending application in the table, **When** I click the approve action, **Then** I should be able to create parent account and child record, and the application status should update to approved
3. **Given** I see a pending application, **When** I click reject, **Then** I should be able to add an optional rejection reason and the status should update to rejected
4. **Given** I approve an application, **When** the parent account is created, **Then** the parent should receive credentials and the child should be enrolled in the requested program
5. **Given** I want to find specific applications, **When** I use search and filters, **Then** I should be able to search by parent name, child name, or filter by status, program, or application date
6. **Given** there are many applications, **When** I view the table, **Then** I should see pagination controls and be able to navigate through pages efficiently

### Edge Cases
- What happens if parent email already exists in system? Show error and allow manual email modification.
- What if child enrollment fails after parent account creation? Rollback parent account or mark for manual intervention.
- How are duplicate applications handled? Show warning if similar parent/child combination exists.
- What if application data is incomplete? Highlight missing fields and allow admin to request additional information.
- What if multiple admins try to process the same application? Block concurrent processing with message showing which admin is currently working on it.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display paginated table of applications with columns for parent name, child name, application date, program requested, and current status
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide search functionality to filter applications by parent name, child name, or contact information
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide status filtering options (pending, approved, rejected, all) with URL state preservation
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow Admin users to approve pending applications through an approval workflow
- **FR-005**: System MUST create parent user account with Parent role when application is approved, requiring parent to set their own password during account activation
- **FR-006**: System MUST create child record linked to parent when application is approved  
- **FR-007**: System MUST create enrollment record linking parent and child when application is approved
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow Admin users to reject applications with optional rejection reason
- **FR-009**: System MUST update application status atomically to prevent race conditions
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate parent email uniqueness before account creation
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide AddChildForm and AddParentForm components for data entry during approval
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce admin-only access through middleware protection
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all application approval/rejection actions to access_logs with basic audit data (admin ID, application ID, action type, timestamp) for audit trail
- **FR-014**: System MUST use enumerated constants for all statuses, roles, and validation rules without hardcoded strings
- **FR-015**: System MUST render initial table server-side with performance under 2 seconds for typical administrative usage
- **FR-016**: System MUST prevent concurrent processing of the same application by blocking access with message indicating which admin is currently processing the application

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Applications table MUST render server-side with Time to First Byte (TTFB) under 2 seconds for typical administrative usage
- **NFR-002**: Approval workflow MUST complete database transactions atomically (parent + child + enrollment creation)
- **NFR-003**: System MUST handle concurrent application processing without data corruption, optimized for low concurrency (1-3 admins per school)
- **NFR-004**: Search and filtering operations MUST execute with query response times under 200ms using optimized database indexing
- **NFR-005**: Component architecture MUST follow micro-functions principle with small, focused files
- **NFR-006**: All database queries MUST be tenant-scoped for multi-tenant security compliance

### Key Entities
- **Application**: Raw application data submitted by prospective families (name, contact, program preference, submission date, status)
- **Parent User Account**: User record with Parent role, authentication credentials, and profile information  
- **Child Record**: Student information linked to parent account with enrollment details
- **Enrollment**: Relationship record connecting parent, child, and program/school assignment
- **Application Status**: Enumerated status values (pending, approved, rejected) with audit timestamps
- **Application Actions**: Admin operations (approve, reject) with user identification and reasoning
