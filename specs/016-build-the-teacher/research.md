# Research: Teacher Management Page

## Overview
Research findings for implementing the Teacher Management page in the Admin Module of montessori-app.

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Database Schema Design
**Decision**: Use existing users table with teacher role + separate teachers table for additional fields
**Rationale**: Leverages existing authentication infrastructure while allowing teacher-specific attributes like wage and nationality
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Single users table with JSON fields (rejected: not type-safe with Drizzle)
- Completely separate teacher accounts (rejected: duplicates auth logic)

### Teacher-Student Assignment Model
**Decision**: Many-to-many relationship using junction table `teacher_students`
**Rationale**: Supports co-teaching model as clarified in spec (students can have multiple teachers)
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct foreign key on students table (rejected: doesn't support co-teaching)
- Complex hierarchy model (rejected: over-engineering for current needs)

### Soft Deletion Strategy
**Decision**: Add `isActive` boolean field to teachers table, default true
**Rationale**: Preserves data integrity and student assignments as specified in clarifications
**Alternatives considered**:
- `deletedAt` timestamp (rejected: more complex queries)
- Status enum (rejected: only need active/inactive for this feature)

### UI Component Strategy
**Decision**: Create scoped components under `app/admin/teachers/components/`
**Rationale**: Follows constitutional Component Reuse Gate, keeps related components together
**Alternatives considered**:
- Global components (rejected: not reusable outside admin context)
- Inline components in page file (rejected: violates Micro Function Gate)

## Integration Patterns

### RBAC Integration
**Decision**: Use existing middleware + page-level role checks
**Rationale**: Consistent with existing admin pages, enforces Multi-Tenant Security Gate
**Implementation**: Check for 'ADMIN' role in middleware and component level

### Database Query Patterns
**Decision**: Use Drizzle ORM with school/tenant scoping on all queries
**Rationale**: Ensures multi-tenant isolation, follows Database Efficiency Gate
**Implementation**: All queries include `where(eq(teachers.schoolId, currentSchoolId))`

### Form Handling
**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Zod validation
**Rationale**: Type-safe forms, consistent with existing codebase patterns
**Implementation**: Client components only for form interactivity, server actions for mutations

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading Strategy
**Decision**: Server-side data fetching with streaming
**Rationale**: Better performance, SEO-friendly, follows Client Directive Gate
**Implementation**: Use React Suspense boundaries for loading states

### Student Assignment UI
**Decision**: Paginated/searchable student list with checkbox selection
**Rationale**: Handles large numbers of students efficiently
**Implementation**: Server-side search and pagination

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
**Decision**: Multi-layered RBAC (middleware + component + API)
**Rationale**: Defense in depth, constitutional requirement
**Implementation**: 
- Middleware blocks non-admin access
- Components check user role
- API routes validate permissions

### Data Validation
**Decision**: Schema validation on both client and server
**Rationale**: Prevents invalid data, good UX with immediate feedback
**Implementation**: Zod schemas shared between client forms and API routes

## Component Architecture

### Page Structure
```
app/admin/teachers/
├── page.tsx                 # Server component, data fetching
├── components/
│   ├── TeacherList.tsx      # Server component, table display
│   ├── TeacherForm.tsx      # Client component, form handling
│   ├── StudentAssignment.tsx # Client component, assignment UI
│   └── TeacherActions.tsx   # Client component, buttons/modals
└── actions.ts               # Server actions for mutations
```

### Data Flow
1. Page component fetches teachers + students server-side
2. TeacherList displays data with status indicators
3. Form components handle user interactions client-side
4. Server actions process mutations with validation
5. Optimistic updates for better UX

## Error Handling Strategy

### Validation Errors
**Decision**: Form-level validation with field-specific error messages
**Implementation**: Zod error formatting, toast notifications for success/failure

### Database Errors
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages
**Implementation**: Try-catch blocks with logging, fallback UI states

### Edge Cases
- Duplicate email handling: Show specific error message
- Inactive teacher assignment: Clearly indicate status in UI
- No students available: Show empty state with helpful message

## Accessibility Considerations

### Screen Reader Support
**Decision**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
**Implementation**: Use shadcn/ui components (built-in accessibility)

### Keyboard Navigation
**Decision**: Full keyboard operability for all interactions
**Implementation**: Focus management in modals, tab order optimization

## Conclusion

Research complete. All technical decisions align with constitutional requirements and support the clarified feature requirements. Ready to proceed to Phase 1 design.
