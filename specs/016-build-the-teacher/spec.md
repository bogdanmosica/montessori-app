## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a School Administrator, I need to manage teacher accounts and student assignments so that I can maintain proper classroom organization and ensure all students have assigned teachers for their educational activities.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in as an Admin, **When** I navigate to `/admin/teachers`, **Then** I see a list of all teachers with their names, emails, and assigned student counts
2. **Given** I am on the teachers page, **When** I click "Add Teacher", **Then** I can create a new teacher account with name, email, and automatic teacher role assignment
3. **Given** I am viewing a teacher's details, **When** I click "Edit Teacher", **Then** I can modify their information and manage their student assignments
4. **Given** I am editing a teacher, **When** I assign students to them, **Then** the database relationships are updated and students appear in their assigned list
5. **Given** I am a non-Admin user, **When** I try to access `/admin/teachers`, **Then** I am denied access and redirected appropriately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a teacher is removed from the system? Teachers are soft deleted (marked inactive) and student assignments are preserved
- How does system handle assigning a student who is already assigned to another teacher? Students can be assigned to multiple teachers (co-teaching is allowed)
- What occurs when attempting to create a teacher with an email that already exists in the system?
- How does the system behave when all students are assigned and a new teacher is added?
- How are inactive teachers distinguished from active teachers in the interface? Inactive teachers show with clear status indicators
